PMC4392313|S2|Title (Randomized)|Effect of interleukin-6 receptor blockade on surrogates of vascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis: MEASURE, a randomised, placebo-controlled study
PMC4392313|S5|Structured Abstract|The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker tocilizumab (TCZ) reduces inflammatory disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but elevates lipid concentrations in some patients.
PMC4392313|S36|Background|Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6R (membrane-bound and soluble) that reduces inflammation and articular damage in patients with RA.
PMC4392313|S41|Background|Thus, given its mode of action, TCZ provides a highly specific molecular intervention with which to dissect the role of IL-6 in the modulation of lipid particles and the regulation of other vascular risk factors in patients with chronic inflammation.
PMC4392313|S42|Objective|We report herein the results of a placebo-controlled trial that sought to define the effects of TCZ on a range of vascular risk surrogates in patients with RA.
PMC4392313|S43|Objective|Our primary hypotheses were that PWV and small LDL particles would be significantly reduced by TCZ.
PMC4392313|S47|Eligibility Criteria|Adult patients with moderately to severely active RA (diagnosed per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria) of more than 6 months’ duration were recruited.
PMC4392313|S48|Eligibility Criteria|Enrolment criteria included inadequate response to stable methotrexate (MTX) therapy, exemplified by a swollen joint count (SJC) ≥6 and a tender joint count (TJC) ≥6, together with C-reactive protein (CRP) >10 mg/L or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >28 mm/h.
PMC4392313|S49|Eligibility Criteria|Patients with inadequate response to an antitumour necrosis factor-α (aTNF) agent during the 6 months before baseline or to more than two previous aTNF agents were ineligible.
PMC4392313|S50|Interventions|MTX therapy was continued during the study.
PMC4392313|S51|Interventions|Initiation of lipid-lowering, oral antidiabetic or antihypertensive medications or change in dose within 12 weeks of baseline was prohibited, and glucocorticoid doses (≤10 mg) had to remain stable.
PMC4392313|S52|Randomization Type|Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (<52 vs ≥52 years), mean arterial blood pressure (<93.3 vs ≥93.3 mm Hg) and CRP (<1.66 vs ≥1.66 mg/dL).
PMC4392313|S54|Trial Design,Data Collection Setting|This two-arm, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase III study was conducted in the USA, Canada and the UK (figure 1) at 34 sites (the MEASURE study).
PMC4392313|S55|Blinding Procedure,Randomization Type,Interventions,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Patients were randomly assigned using an interactive voice response system to blinded (patient and treating clinical team) intravenous treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, both in combination with oral MTX, every 4 weeks for 6 months between November 2007 and June 2008.
PMC4392313|S56|Interventions|Patients who, despite scheduled infusions of double-blind study medication at weeks 8 and 12, did not achieve ≥20% improvement from baseline in SJC and TJC at week 16 were offered escape therapy with open-label TCZ 8 mg/kg.
PMC4392313|S57|Interventions|At completion of the 24-week randomised treatment period, all patients were offered open-label treatment with TCZ 8 mg/kg plus MTX.
PMC4392313|S58|Outcomes|Assessments during part 1 (randomised phase) of the study were performed at day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24.
PMC4392313|S59|Registry/Number,Outcomes|Open-label assessments were performed every 12 weeks to week 104 (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00535782).
PMC4392313|S60|Protocol Access|The study protocol (version C, 22 June 2009 (original protocol published 10 May 2007)) is available as online supplementary material.
PMC4392313|S61|Trial Design,Interventions|Figure 1 Study design.
PMC4392313|S75|Outcomes|Arterial stiffness was assessed by PWV according to the manufacturer's instructions using a pulse wave analysis apparatus (SphygmoCor; AtCor, San Jose, California, USA).19
PMC4392313|S79|Outcomes|The primary objective was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with TCZ on PWV and on small LDL particle number assessed by NMR compared with placebo.
PMC4392313|S80|Outcomes|The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of TCZ compared with placebo on these measurements at week 24.
PMC4392313|S82|Sample Size Determination|A sample size of 120 patients (60 per arm), calculated based on previous results in patients with RA,5 18 was expected to provide sufficient power to detect a difference at week 12 in PWV (−1.14 m/s) and small LDL (−5.51 mg/dL (30% reduction)) in patients treated with TCZ compared with placebo.
PMC4392313|S83|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The co-primary efficacy end points of change from baseline in PWV and small LDL particle number were analysed by parametric analysis of covariance.
PMC4392313|S84|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The 12-week and 24-week efficacy analyses of primary and secondary end points were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using last-observation-carried-forward to impute missing data at the analysis time point.
PMC4392313|S86|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|All other exploratory end points were summarised for the ITT population observed cases, without imputation of missing data and excluding escape data.
PMC4392313|S89|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Primary end points in the study were analysed based on a normal distribution; however, because baseline values for several laboratory assessments in this study demonstrated non-normal distributions, values for exploratory serum analytes are presented as medians or median percentage changes from baseline.
PMC4392313|S90|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Exploratory analyses, based on observed cases, were performed using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test.
PMC4392313|S91|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Hodges–Lehmann estimates of location shift and 95% CIs are presented.
PMC4392313|S94|Participant Flow|Sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ+MTX and sixty-three to receive placebo+MTX (figure 1).
PMC4392313|S95|Participant Flow|Sixty-five and sixty patients, respectively, completed 12 weeks of therapy.
PMC4392313|S96|Participant Loss and Exclusion|One patient in each arm withdrew because of an adverse event; one patient on placebo withdrew because of insufficient therapeutic response, three patients in the TCZ arm refused treatment and one patient in the TCZ arm was withdrawn because of a protocol violation.
PMC4392313|S97|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Two patients in the TCZ arm had their lipid-lowering medications changed; though included in the ITT analyses, they were excluded from the per-protocol analyses.
PMC4392313|S98|Participant Flow|Of 124 patients who completed blinded treatment, 117 elected to continue to the open-label phase; 92 completed treatment for 96 weeks.
PMC4392313|S99|Baseline Data|Demographic and baseline disease characteristics (table 1) were similar to those of the TCZ phase III cohort.20
PMC4392313|S100|Baseline Data|Moreover, 30% and 39% of the patients in the placebo and TCZ arms, respectively, had previously received aTNFs.
PMC4392313|S102|Harms|Adverse events and serious adverse events occurring during the trial were similar to those observed in previous TCZ studies (see online supplementary table S1).
PMC4392313|S103|Baseline Data|Table 1 Demographic and disease factors at baseline
PMC4392313|S104|Outcome Results|Consistent with results from TCZ phase III clinical trials, median total cholesterol and LDL-C levels increased in TCZ recipients but did not change in placebo patients (table 2).
PMC4392313|S105|Outcome Results|In contrast, no statistically significant difference in the co-primary outcome of concentration of small LDL particles was observed at either week 12 (adjusted mean difference −0.0 (95% CI −115.0 to 115.0) nmol/L) or week 24 (adjusted mean difference 11.2 (95% CI −106.7 to 129.1) nmol/L) after treatment with TCZ compared with placebo (figure 2A).
PMC4392313|S106|Outcome Results|Oxidised LDL exhibited a 7% increase on TCZ treatment that was not significantly different from the increase observed with placebo and did not persist at week 24 (figure 2B).
PMC4392313|S107|Outcome Results|By contrast, Lp(a) was reduced (by 37%) in TCZ recipients (figure 2C) compared with controls.

PMC4392313|S109|Outcome Results|Figure 2 (A–F) Effects on lipoproteins (TCZ vs placebo).
PMC4392313|S112|Outcome Results|Measurement of change in PWV (second co-primary outcome) over 12 weeks revealed a significant difference between groups (adjusted mean difference 0.79 m/s (95% CI 0.22 to 1.35; p=0.0067)), constituting a greater relative reduction in PWV in placebo compared with TCZ-treated patients (−0.99 vs −0.21 m/s).
PMC4392313|S113|Outcome Results|The group difference was not sustained to week 24 (−0.47 vs −0.17 m/s; adjusted mean difference 0.30 m/s (95% CI −0.27 to 0.87; p=0.30)) (table 3).
PMC4392313|S117|Outcome Results|Table 3 Change from baseline in PWV (LOCF), ITT population
PMC4392313|S118|Ancillary Analyses|No statistically significant changes occurred in total serum HDL-C levels in the study.
PMC4392313|S119|Ancillary Analyses|NMR evaluation of HDL, however, revealed differential effects of TCZ versus placebo across particle sizes, with observed elevations in small HDL concentration and reductions in medium HDL (table 2).
PMC4392313|S120|Ancillary Analyses|A significant reduction (by 78%) was observed in the TCZ arm for HDL-associated SAA.
PMC4392313|S121|Ancillary Analyses|In contrast, a significant increase (by 16%) was noted in the antioxidative enzyme paraoxonase I, which is almost exclusively carried in serum HDL (figure 2D–F).
PMC4392313|S122|Ancillary Analyses|sPLA2-IIA was reduced (by 61%) in TCZ recipients.
PMC4392313|S123|Ancillary Analyses|No changes were observed in the control population in these biomarkers.
PMC4392313|S124|Ancillary Analyses|Alterations occurred rapidly (by week 2) and were sustained throughout therapy.
PMC4392313|S125|Ancillary Analyses|Results of NMR subfractionation of other lipoprotein subclasses are shown in table 2.
PMC4392313|S126|Ancillary Analyses|In patients treated with TCZ, changes in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subclasses were elevated compared with placebo, with changes in the largest components of the VLDL subclasses most notable, though they constituted a small proportion of the total VLDL particles.
PMC4392313|S127|Ancillary Analyses|Similarly, no significant changes in the concentrations of intermediate, buoyant particles (large LDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein) occurred in TCZ-treated patients compared with placebo patients.
PMC4392313|S128|Ancillary Analyses|Median triglyceride levels increased in TCZ-treated patients but did not change in placebo patients.
PMC4392313|S129|Ancillary Analyses|Markers of inflammation, including CRP and haptoglobin, were elevated at baseline and markedly reduced within the first week of TCZ treatment (figure 3).
PMC4392313|S130|Ancillary Analyses|Similarly, rapid and sustained reductions in fibrinogen (by 47% from baseline) and d-dimer (by 62% from baseline) were observed in recipients of TCZ, whereas no changes were observed in the control arm (figure 3).
PMC4392313|S131|Ancillary Analyses|All changes remained stable throughout TCZ treatment.
PMC4392313|S132|Ancillary Analyses|Finally, the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio did not change throughout the study in either group (table 2).
PMC4392313|S133|Ancillary Analyses|Figure 3 (A–D) Effects on inflammatory and thrombotic markers (TCZ vs placebo).
PMC4392313|S138|Interpretation|However, neither hypothesis was supported.
PMC4392313|S141|Interpretation|Thus, we report that TCZ did modulate lipid particle levels (LDL, HDL, VLDL) and composition (HDL-associated SAA), together with a number of other inflammatory (CRP, paraoxonase) and vascular (Lp(a), D-dimer, fibrinogen) risk factors, suggesting potential modulation of the net atherogenic risk profile.
PMC4392313|S142|Interpretation|Consistent with results from other TCZ phase III clinical trials, total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride levels increased in TCZ-treated patients but were minimally changed in placebo patients.
PMC4392313|S148|Limitations|It should be noted, however, that technical challenges during the conduct of this multicentre trial led to approximately 15% of the measurements being substandard.
PMC4392313|S149|Limitations|Because of the severity of disease in study participants who had reduced mobility, contractures and joint pain, the procedure proved more difficult than anticipated.
PMC4392313|S151|Interpretation|Our findings contrast with those of Kume et al,21 who observed similar reductions in cardio-ankle vascular index and aortic augmentation index for patients treated with TCZ, adalimumab or etanercept.
PMC4392313|S152|Interpretation|Speculatively, it remains possible that disease-related vascular changes in patients in the present study (in which mean DAS28 was high) were much more progressed (and, thus, less reversible) than in patients studied in other trials.18 21
PMC4392313|S154|Interpretation|Our demonstration of a significant increase in the concentration of small HDL particles with TCZ treatment is consistent with a potential ‘normalisation’ of small HDL particle levels.
PMC4392313|S156|Interpretation|Furthermore, the observed significant reduction in medium HDL and HDL-SAA concentrations, along with the increase in paraoxonase, an antioxidant enzyme associated with HDL, suggests remodelling of HDL particles from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to TCZ treatment.
PMC4392313|S157|Interpretation|Overall, such changes in HDL particle composition with TCZ are consistent with the results of a recent study of aTNFs in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.22
PMC4392313|S158|Interpretation|Although it is unclear to what extent small HDL particles measured by NMR corroborate with those measured by other methods, small HDL particles may be more active in cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory functions,23 though this observation remains debated.
PMC4392313|S163|Interpretation|Consistent with our results and the TCZ phase III programme,7 the TCZ-based IL-6 signal inhibition may reduce various receptor surface levels and sPLA2-IIA levels, leading to both decreased LDL and VLDL tissue retention and elevated circulating levels.
PMC4392313|S169|Interpretation|Collectively, these changes suggest a reduction in thrombotic potential with TCZ in patients with active RA.
PMC4392313|S171|Interpretation|In summary, the results of this randomised, placebo-controlled study suggest that IL-6R blockade with TCZ in patients with active RA not only reduces markers of inflammation but also affects quantitative and qualitative changes in lipids and lipoproteins.
PMC4392313|S172|Interpretation|Such changes include a global increase in LDL-C concentration, in line with findings from other biological studies,7 and apparently favourable changes to HDL particle composition, rendering them less pro-inflammatory.

PMC3018567|S2|Title (Randomized)|Effect of single-dose anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy on an infant's response to immunisation and on susceptibility to infectious diseases in infancy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
PMC3018567|S4|Structured Abstract|Background
PMC3018567|S8|Trial Design|In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled 2507 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy who were planning to deliver in Entebbe General Hospital, Entebbe, Uganda.
PMC3018567|S13|Registry/Number|This trial is registered, number ISRCTN32849447.
PMC3018567|S32|Background|Such overlap in disease distributions has led to the suggestion that chronic helminth infections could affect the epidemiological patterns of other diseases,10 through impairment of immune responses to immunisations and unrelated infections.
PMC3018567|S39|Background|However, evidence exists that prenatal exposure to maternal helminth infection could have important effects on an infant's immune response.
PMC3018567|S41|Background|Such findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal helminth infection modulates an infant's immune response to vaccination and infectious pathogens, and that anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy can prevent these effects.
PMC3018567|S42|Objective|We designed this trial of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy to address this hypothesis.
PMC3018567|S43|Objective|We also examined effects of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy on infant mortality, and on anaemia and growth at age 1 year, to assess the overall risks and benefits of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy.
PMC3018567|S47|Data Collection Setting|Briefly, the study area was Entebbe Municipality and Katabi subcounty, beside Lake Victoria, Uganda.
PMC3018567|S50|Data Collection Setting,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|The study population consisted of pregnant women who presented at the government-funded antenatal clinic at Entebbe General Hospital between April 9, 2003, and Nov 24, 2005, where roughly 70% of pregnant women from the study area received antenatal care.21
PMC3018567|S51|Eligibility Criteria|Women were included if resident in the study area, planning to deliver in the hospital, willing to know their HIV status, and in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.
PMC3018567|S52|Eligibility Criteria|They were excluded if they had possible helminth-induced pathological changes (haemoglobin <80 g/L, clinically apparent severe liver disease, or diarrhoea with blood in stool), a history of an adverse reaction to anthelmintics, already been enrolled in the trial during an earlier pregnancy, or if the pregnancy was deemed abnormal by a midwife.
PMC3018567|S56|Randomization Type,Interventions|We used a two-by-two factorial design to randomly assign patients in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive simultaneously either single-dose albendazole (440 mg) and single-dose praziquantel (40 mg/kg), albendazole and a praziquantel-matching placebo, an albendazole-matching placebo and praziquantel, or an albendazole-matching placebo and a praziquantel-matching placebo (albendazole and matching placebo, Glaxosmithkline, Brentford, UK; praziquantel and matching placebo, Medochemie Ltd, Limassal, Cyprus).
PMC3018567|S57|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Randomization Type|The randomisation code was generated by the trial statistician with a computer-generated random number sequence, with block size 100.
PMC3018567|S58|Allocation Concealment Mechanism|Treatments were packed in sealed envelopes and labelled with an allocation number by colleagues at the Medical Research Council Unit in Entebbe who did not otherwise contribute to the trial.
PMC3018567|S59|Randomization Implementation|Treatments were allocated in numerical order by trained interviewer-counsellors who observed the patients taking the treatment correctly on enrolment to the study.
PMC3018567|S60|Blinding Procedure|Treatment allocation was masked from all participants and staff during the study.
PMC3018567|S70|Outcomes|The primary outcomes were immune response at age 1 year to BCG, tetanus, and measles immunisation; incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and tuberculosis during infancy as diagnosed by doctors at the study clinic; and vertical HIV transmission.18
PMC3018567|S71|Outcomes|Planned secondary outcomes were growth and anaemia at age 1 year.
PMC3018567|S72|Outcomes|Community-reported data for illness events were included as a secondary outcome for comparison with doctor-diagnosed illness events from clinic visits.
PMC3018567|S73|Outcomes|We also considered two additional unplanned secondary outcomes: infant mortality and asymptomatic malaria (presence of malaria parasitaemia) at 1 year of age.
PMC3018567|S74|Outcomes|Cytokine responses at 1 year of age to crude culture filtrate proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (cCFP) were measured as an indicator of response to BCG immunisation.
PMC3018567|S75|Outcomes|Cytokine responses at age 1 year to tetanus toxoid were measured as an indicator of response to tetanus immunisation.
PMC3018567|S76|Outcomes|We examined stimulated interferon-γ (type 1), interleukin-5 (type 2), interleukin-13 (type 2), and interleukin-10 (regulatory) responses in a whole-blood assay, as previously described.23
PMC3018567|S77|Outcomes|Total serum IgG, IgG4, and IgE responses to tetanus toxoid were measured by ELISA (webappendix p 1).
PMC3018567|S78|Outcomes|Total serum measles-specific IgG was measured by ELISA (Dade Behring/Siemens, Eschborn, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
PMC3018567|S80|Outcomes|For the primary outcome, doctor-diagnosed illness events, clinical malaria was fever (temperature ≥37·5°C) with parasitaemia; diarrhoea was an infant's carer's definition, with stool frequency recorded;24 pneumonia was cough with difficulty in breathing, and age-specific fast breathing;25 measles was defined by standard clinical criteria and confirmed by measurement of specific antibody;26 and children with suspected tuberculosis were investigated as clinically indicated.27
PMC3018567|S81|Outcomes|For the secondary outcome, community-reported illnesses, febrile illness was defined as measured by fieldworkers (temperature ≥37·5°C) or as reported by the child's carer; diarrhoea as reported by the carer, with stool frequency recorded; presumptive pneumonia was cough with difficulty in breathing, or age-specific fast breathing as measured by fieldworkers.
PMC3018567|S82|Outcomes|Stool samples were examined for helminth ova with the Kato-Katz method28 and by charcoal culture for Strongyloides sterocoralis infection;29 two Kato-Katz slides were prepared from each sample and examined for hookworm ova within 30 mins of preparation, or examined the next day for other species.
PMC3018567|S83|Outcomes|Hookworm and Schistosoma mansoni infections were classified into low, medium, and high intensities according to WHO guidelines.30
PMC3018567|S84|Outcomes|Blood samples were examined by a modified Knott's method for Mansonella perstans31 and by thick film for malaria parasites.
PMC3018567|S85|Outcomes|Haemoglobin was estimated by Coulter analyser (Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland).
PMC3018567|S86|Outcomes|Quality control for Kato-Katz analyses was provided by the Vector Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, Uganda, and for haematology and malaria parasitology through the UK National External Quality Assessment Schemes.
PMC3018567|S87|Outcomes|Mothers' HIV serology was done by rapid test algorithm.30
PMC3018567|S88|Outcomes|Blood was obtained from cord and at 6 weeks of age from infants of mothers with HIV for assessment of vertical HIV transmission.
PMC3018567|S89|Outcomes|Plasma and whole blood cell pellet were separated by centrifugation and stored at −80°C until assays were done.
PMC3018567|S90|Outcomes|For detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA in infants at 6 weeks, DNA was extracted from stored whole blood cell pellets and amplified by nested PCR of three conserved viral regions, tat, gp41, and nef (webappendix p 1).
PMC3018567|S91|Outcomes|For both cord and 6-week samples, plasma HIV load was measured with Bayer Versant branched DNA assay version 3.0 (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) or Roche Amplicor HIV-1 RNA Monitor test version 1.5 (Roche, NJ, USA).
PMC3018567|S92|Outcomes|Infants were regarded as being HIV positive if the 6-week sample had a positive DNA PCR for any of the viral regions and a viral load of 1000 copies per mL or more; for four infants, only viral load data were available, so they were used to establish HIV status.
PMC3018567|S94|Outcomes|In infants with HIV infection, transmission was regarded as likely to have been intrauterine if the viral load in cord blood was 1000 copies per mL or more.
PMC3018567|S97|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Data for samples and measurements obtained at routine, 1-year visits were included if the child attended within 2 months after their first birthday.
PMC3018567|S99|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Results for younger twins were excluded from all analyses.
PMC3018567|S100|Sample Size Determination|On the basis of our preliminary study,32 the planned cohort size of 2500 was expected to accrue 1860 person-years of follow-up in infancy and 1594 infants were expected to be seen at age 1 year.
PMC3018567|S101|Sample Size Determination|For either maternal treatment, assuming no interaction between treatments, this number would give 80% power to detect rate ratios of 0·82 for malaria, 0·91 for diarrhoea, and 0·76 for pneumonia, with p values of less than 0·05, assuming frequency of disease in the placebo groups to be 50 per 100 person-years for malaria,33 190 per 100 person-years for diarrhoea,34 and 25 per 100 person-years for pneumonia.35
PMC3018567|S105|Participant Loss and Exclusion|For immune response at age 1 year, analysis included all children who provided a blood sample at 1 year and who had received full BCG (for cCFP analysis) or tetanus (for tetanus toxoid analysis) immunisation at Entebbe Hospital; second-born twins were excluded.
PMC3018567|S106|Participant Loss and Exclusion|For incidence of infectious diseases during infancy, analysis included all liveborn children, excluding second-born twins.
PMC3018567|S107|Participant Loss and Exclusion|For vertical HIV transmission, analysis included all children whose mothers were not receiving highly-active antiretroviral therapy, and from whom blood samples at age 6 weeks were available; second-born twins were excluded.
PMC3018567|S109|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Results were transformed to log10(concentration+1) and analysed by linear regression with bootstrapping to estimate bias-corrected accelerated confidence intervals.36
PMC3018567|S110|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Regression coefficients were back-transformed to give geometric mean ratios.
PMC3018567|S111|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Interactions were examined with Wald tests.
PMC3018567|S114|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|For each disease, we calculated incidence rates for all events.
PMC3018567|S116|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Hazard ratios (HRs) for effects of treatment were calculated with Cox regression, with robust SEs to allow for within-child clustering.
PMC3018567|S117|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|For community-reported illness data, a generalised-estimating-equation approach with exchangeable correlation structure was used to model effects of treatment on repeated binary outcomes.
PMC3018567|S118|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Odds ratios (ORs) for the effects of treatment on vertical HIV transmission were calculated with logistic regression.
PMC3018567|S119|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria at 1 year was compared between treatment groups with logistic regression.
PMC3018567|S120|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Infant mortality per 1000 livebirths was estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities to age 1 year, and effects of maternal anthelmintic treatment were assessed by Cox regression.
PMC3018567|S121|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height Z scores at 1 year were derived from WHO growth standard reference scales, with igrowup macros.
PMC3018567|S122|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We examined effects of maternal treatment on Z scores and on haemoglobin at 1 year by linear regression.
PMC3018567|S123|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We did two prespecified subgroup analyses, examining effects of albendazole treatment in children of mothers with a hookworm infection, and effects of praziquantel treatment in children of mothers with schistosomiasis.
PMC3018567|S124|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Differences between subgroups were examined by fitting interaction terms in regression models.
PMC3018567|S125|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|All p values were two-sided with no adjustment made for multiple comparisons.
PMC3018567|S126|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Analyses were done with Stata 10.1.

PMC3018567|S137|Numbers Analyzed|Of these infants, 2092 (90%) remained in follow-up at 1 year of age, of whom 1701 (81%) attended the 1-year visit.
PMC3018567|S146|Outcome Results|We noted no evidence of interaction between maternal albendazole and praziquantel treatments for any outcome (all interaction p values>0·1; webappendix pp 3–4); therefore the effects of each treatment were assessed independently.
PMC3018567|S147|Numbers Analyzed|Results for cytokine responses at age 1 year were available for 1542 infants, of whom 1506 had received BCG immunisation at birth at Entebbe Hospital and 1015 had received all three doses of tetanus immunisation at Entebbe Hospital.
PMC3018567|S148|Outcome Results|The proportion of infants for whom positive responses to cCFP and tetanus toxoid were detected varied by cytokine; for cCFP, 1356 (90%) infants had positive responses to interferon-γ, 449 (30%) had positive responses to interleukin 5, 1005 (67%) had positive responses to interleukin 13, and 1316 (87%) had positive responses to interleukin-10.
PMC3018567|S149|Outcome Results|For tetanus toxoid, 655 (65%) infants had positive responses to interferon-γ, 499 (49%) had positive responses to interleukin 5, 766 (75%) had positive responses to interleukin 13, and 498 (49%) had positive responses to interleukin 10.
PMC3018567|S150|Outcome Results|Albendazole treatment of mothers was associated with a small reduction in unstimulated interleukin-10 production by their children (geometric mean ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·70–0·98).
PMC3018567|S151|Outcome Results|We recorded no other overall effects of maternal treatment on unstimulated cytokine production.
PMC3018567|S152|Outcome Results|Results for effects on responses to stimulation were similar, irrespective of whether background cytokine production was subtracted (data not shown).

PMC3018567|S155|Outcome Results|We detected no effects of either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on the overall antigen-specific response after immunisation (table 2).
PMC3018567|S156|Outcome Results|However, in infants of mothers with a hookworm infection, maternal albendazole treatment was associated with a small non-significant reduction in the interferon-γ response to cCFP and with reductions in their response to tetanus toxoid for the type 2 cytokines interleukin 5 and interleukin 13 (table 3).
PMC3018567|S157|Outcome Results|We recorded no significant effect of praziquantel treatment in infants of mothers with schistosomiasis (table 3).
PMC3018567|S158|Outcome Results|We recorded no overall effects for either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on antibody concentrations for tetanus or measles (table 2), nor did we detect differential effects for either albendazole or praziquantel treatment according to susceptible worm species (table 3).
PMC3018567|S159|Outcome Results|Of the 2315 liveborn children, 2083 (90%) made at least one illness-related clinic visit during infancy.
PMC3018567|S160|Outcome Results|The number of illness visits by children in all four treatment groups were similar (webappendix p 4).
PMC3018567|S161|Outcome Results|During the study period, the rate of malaria was 41 episodes per 100 person-years (95% CI 38–44), of diarrhoea 134 episodes per 100 person-years (129–139), and of pneumonia 22 episodes per 100 person-years (20–24).
PMC3018567|S162|Outcome Results|Measles and tuberculosis were rare, with two episodes of each, so we could not assess the effect of maternal anthelmintic treatment on their frequency.

PMC3018567|S164|Outcome Results|Table 5 Effect of maternal anthelmintic treatment in pregnancy on disease incidence, by maternal helminth status
PMC3018567|S165|Outcome Results|We noted no evidence for effects of either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on doctor-diagnosed malaria, diarrhoea, or pneumonia incidence (table 4).
PMC3018567|S166|Ancillary Analyses|Subgroup analyses by maternal hookworm and schistosomiasis infection status showed no evidence of a differential effect of either treatment according to susceptible worm species (table 5).
PMC3018567|S167|Participant Loss and Exclusion|299 women tested positive for HIV at enrolment; of these, 16 were lost to follow-up before delivery, five had miscarriages, and nine had stillbirths.
PMC3018567|S168|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Five women were on highly-active antiretroviral therapy; their children, and seven second-born twins were excluded from the analysis, leaving 264 infants suitable for inclusion.
PMC3018567|S169|Binary Outcome Results|6-week blood samples were available from 211 infants (80%), of whom 39 (18%) were diagnosed with HIV infection.
PMC3018567|S170|Outcome Results|Of infants with HIV infection, 31 had cord samples available, of which 20 (65%) showed an HIV viral load of 1000 copies per mL or more, which is consistent with intrauterine HIV transmission.
PMC3018567|S171|Outcome Results|We recorded no evidence for any effect of either albendazole (OR 0·70, 95% CI 0·35–1·42; p=0·33) or praziquantel (0·60, 0·29–1·23; p=0·17) treatment on vertical HIV transmission, although statistical power was restricted because the study was only powered to detect a large effect for this outcome.
PMC3018567|S172|Outcome Results|No evidence was noted for any differential effect of treatment according to susceptible worm species; ORs for the effect of albendazole treatment on HIV transmission were 0·77 (0·25–2·40) in mothers with hookworm infection and 0·66 (0·27–1·60) in those without hookworm infection (interaction p=0·83).
PMC3018567|S173|Outcome Results|We recorded similar results for praziquantel (OR 0·75, 0·18–3·14, for mothers with schistosomiasis; 0·56, 0·24–1·29 for those without schistosomiasis; interaction p=0·73).
PMC3018567|S174|Outcome Results|For the secondary outcome of community-reported illness data, the overall recorded prevalences of each illness collated every 14 days throughout infancy was 13% for febrile illness, 12% for diarrhoea, and 1% for presumptive pneumonia.
PMC3018567|S175|Outcome Results|These data were consistent with doctor-diagnosed outcomes and showed no effects of treatment with albendazole or praziquantel on febrile illnesses (OR 1·07, 95% CI 0·97–1·18, p=0·18; and 1·03, 0·93–1·13, 0·58), diarrhoea (1·08, 0·98–1·20, 0·13; and 0·93, 0·84–1·03, 0·18), or presumptive pneumonia (0·92, 0·65–1·31, 0·66; and 0·91, 0·64–1·30, 0·62).
PMC3018567|S176|Outcome Results|The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia at 1 year was similar between treatment groups (webappendix p 5).
PMC3018567|S177|Outcome Results|81 infants in the cohort died, 44 of whom were neonates, giving a neonatal mortality rate of 19·0 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 14·2–25·5) and an infant mortality rate of 35·7 per 1000 livebirths (28·8–44·2).
PMC3018567|S178|Outcome Results|Maternal anthelmintic treatment had no pronounced effect on mortality (webappendix p 5).
PMC3018567|S180|Outcome Results|Mean haemoglobin score at age 1 year was 102 g/L (SD 14 g/L).
PMC3018567|S181|Outcome Results|We noted no evidence for any difference in mean growth indices or mean haemoglobin between children of albendazole-treated and placebo-treated mothers, or between children of praziquantel-treated and placebo-treated mothers (webappendix p 5).
PMC3018567|S182|Harms|Numbers of serious adverse events are reported elsewhere19 and were distributed evenly between treatment groups.
PMC3018567|S185|Interpretation|One dose of albendazole was effective for the treatment of hookworm and A lumbricoides infections, and praziquantel was effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis.
PMC3018567|S187|Interpretation|Thus we would have expected to see any noticeable effects of the removal of these maternal helminth infections.
PMC3018567|S188|Limitations|A possible source of imprecision is that the Kato-Katz method has suboptimum sensitivity for diagnosis of intestinal helminth infections when one stool sample is used.38,39
PMC3018567|S189|Interpretation|In this study, the sensitivity for detecting both hookworm infection and schistosomiasis was greater when three stool samples were taken than when only one was taken.
PMC3018567|S192|Interpretation|These results should be interpreted with caution because of the large number of statistical tests done, but they accord with earlier findings40,41 on effects of helminths on type-2 responses to tetanus immunisation in adults; by contrast with these previous studies,40,41 we recorded no reciprocal effect on interferon-γ response.
PMC3018567|S193|Interpretation|Such responses will probably not change the effectiveness of tetanus immunisation, because this immunisation depends on the production of toxin-neutralising IgG antibodies, which was not affected by maternal treatment.
PMC3018567|S194|Interpretation|However, the patterns recorded lend support to the hypothesis that maternal helminths promote a type-2 bias in an infant's response to unrelated antigens and that anthelmintic treatment modifies this effect.
PMC3018567|S195|Interpretation|These findings suggest that the effect of anthelmintic treatment can be transmitted in utero.
PMC3018567|S196|Interpretation|Neither intervention showed any overall effect on response to BCG immunisation in infants.
PMC3018567|S198|Interpretation|In the present, larger study, interferon-γ responses were higher in infants of mothers with hookworm infection, and albendazole treatment was associated with a weak reduction in interferon-γ responses in infants of women with hookworm infection.
PMC3018567|S199|Interpretation|These findings contrast with our initial hypothesis that maternal hookworm infection would inhibit the Th1 response and that albendazole treatment would reverse this effect.
PMC3018567|S200|Interpretation|The absence of effect of praziquantel treatment was also unexpected, in view of Malhotra and colleagues' finding17 that infants who are sensitised to schistosome or filarial antigens in utero had reduced interferon-γ and increased interleukin-5 responses to neonatal BCG immunisation.
PMC3018567|S202|Interpretation|The idea that single-dose praziquantel treatment completely removes the likelihood of fetal sensitisation to schistosome antigens might be too simplistic, because worm and egg antigens can take some time to be cleared from maternal tissues.
PMC3018567|S203|Interpretation|Moreover, the killing of adult schistosomes results in release of worm antigen into the circulation and might have complex effects on the fetus, dependent on placental transfer of antigens or antibodies and the stage of development of the fetal immune system.41,42
PMC3018567|S204|Interpretation|The recorded effects on an infant's response to tetanus immunisation contrasted with the absence of effects seen for measles and BCG.
PMC3018567|S205|Interpretation|A possible explanation is that tetanus immunisation given to women during pregnancy could have led to the priming of an infant's antitetanus response in utero,42 and the profile of the primed response could have been affected by concomitant exposure to a maternal helminth infection, which depended on whether or not an infant's mother received treatment with albendazole.
PMC3018567|S207|Limitations|A possible source of imprecision is that data for doctor-diagnosed disease incidence were obtained passively, and therefore rates are likely to have been underestimated.
PMC3018567|S208|Interpretation|However, 90% of infants attended the clinic for illness at least once, and underestimation would be non-differential between treatment groups; therefore this imprecision is unlikely to have affected our findings.
PMC3018567|S209|Interpretation|Moreover, results from community-reported illness events (which are less likely to be under-reported), and malaria parasitaemia at 1 year of age (which is independent of reporting biases) were both consistent with the recorded absence of treatment effect.
PMC3018567|S210|Limitations|We also detected no evidence that anthelmintic treatment affected vertical transmission of HIV, although power to detect an effect was restricted.
PMC3018567|S212|Interpretation|We recorded no such effect, although the number of deaths in the cohort was small so the possibility of a reduction cannot be ruled out.
PMC3018567|S216|Interpretation|Consistency between all cytokine responses was expected, and can be interpreted as compelling evidence of an effect, compared with isolated change in an individual response.
PMC3018567|S218|Interpretation,Limitations|In the event, very few outcomes showed any evidence of association at a p value less than 0·05 so absence of adjustment for multiplicity is unlikely to have affected the interpretation of our results.
PMC3018567|S219|Interpretation|A strength of this study was the randomised intervention design; effects of helminth infections reported in observational studies could have been affected by confounding factors.
PMC3018567|S220|Interpretation|Our findings do not show that exposure to maternal helminth infections in utero has no important effect on the development of the fetal immune system.
PMC3018567|S222|Interpretation|Rather, our findings suggest that one effective anthelmintic intervention given in the second or third trimester of pregnancy is insufficient to alter any effect of maternal worms on vaccine and infectious disease outcomes in infancy.
PMC3018567|S225|Generalizability|Our results are generalisable to areas with high prevalence but low intensity of helminth infection in young adults, which is a common pattern in areas that are endemic for helminth infection.
PMC3018567|S226|Generalizability|Findings might differ in populations with higher infection intensities.
PMC3018567|S227|Interpretation|These results suggest that, in settings such as Entebbe Municipality and Katabi subcounty, single-dose anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy has no benefit for an infant's response to immunisation, or for their health and development.
PMC3018567|S229|Interpretation|These results contrast with the expected benefits of routine antenatal anthelmintic treatment recently advocated,44 and the value of such a policy may need to be reviewed.

PMC3266479|S2|Title (Randomized)|Effect of intravenous β-2 agonist treatment on clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (BALTI-2): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial
PMC3266479|S5|Structured Abstract|In a previous randomised controlled phase 2 trial, intravenous infusion of salbutamol for up to 7 days in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reduced extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure.
PMC3266479|S14|Registry/Number|This trial is registered, ISRCTN38366450 and EudraCT number 2006-002647-86.
PMC3266479|S25|Funding|UK Medical Research Council, UK Department of Health, UK Intensive Care Foundation.
PMC3266479|S32|Background|Findings from the β-agonist lung injury trial (BALTI)13—a single-centre, randomised controlled trial in 40 patients with ARDS—showed that an infusion of salbutamol for 7 days caused significant reductions in extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure.
PMC3266479|S33|Background|However, this trial was not designed to assess the potential effects on mortality.
PMC3266479|S34|Objective|We therefore assessed whether treatment with salbutamol in the early course of ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.
PMC3266479|S37|Data Collection Setting,Trial Design,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|We undertook a multicentre, pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised trial at 46 UK intensive-care units between December, 2006, and March, 2010.
PMC3266479|S38|Eligibility Criteria|Eligible participants were intubated and mechanically ventilated adults aged 16 years and older within 72 h of ARDS onset.
PMC3266479|S39|Randomization Implementation|Patients were identified and recruited by local investigators at each site.
PMC3266479|S40|Eligibility Criteria|We defined ARDS in accordance with the American European Consensus criteria:14 a pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO2/FIO2) ratio of 200 mm Hg or less, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with oedema, and the absence of clinically evident left atrial hypertension.
PMC3266479|S41|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria were pregnancy; current treatment with intravenous β-2 agonist or need for continuous, regular, aerolised β-2 agonists; current treatment with β-adrenergic antagonists; imminent withdrawal of medical treatment; chronic liver disease, defined as Child-Pugh grade C; and enrolment in another clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product within the previous 28 days.
PMC3266479|S49|Similarity of Interventions|The active and placebo drug components of the infusions were packaged identically into numbered treatment packs, each containing 5 mL of either salbutamol sulphate BP (1 mg/mL in a sterile isotonic solution, GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) or placebo (0·9% sterile sodium chloride).
PMC3266479|S50|Randomization Type,Random Allocation Sequence Generation|We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence with a block size of eight.
PMC3266479|S51|Randomization Implementation|Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a centralised 24 h telephone or web-based randomisation service (University of Aberdeen, UK).
PMC3266479|S52|Randomization Implementation|Randomisation was minimised by centre, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (≤50, 51–99, or ≥100 mm Hg), and age (<64, 65–84, ≥85 years).
PMC3266479|S53|Blinding Procedure|Participants, care providers, and investigators were masked to group assignment.
PMC3266479|S56|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We used the APACHE II score to calculate the mortality risk, which we used for subgroup analysis.
PMC3266479|S58|Interventions|The protocol recommended use of a lung protective ventilation strategy on the basis of ideal bodyweight,17 fluid restriction,18 and appropriate high positive end-expiratory pressure.19
PMC3266479|S59|Interventions|Compliance with recommendations for protective ventilation were assessed at baseline only (tidal volumes per kg ideal bodyweight).
PMC3266479|S60|Interventions|All other treatments were delivered in accordance with local clinical practice.
PMC3266479|S61|Interventions|Before the start of recruitment, the intensive-care unit nurse was trained to monitor side-effects of the treatment and to inform the research team as necessary.
PMC3266479|S62|Interventions|Infusion syringes were prepared immediately before use by the nurse and contained two ampoules of the blinded solutions (salbutamol or placebo) diluted with 40 mL of saline in a 50 mL syringe.
PMC3266479|S63|Interventions|Salbutamol and placebo were administered through a dedicated intravenous line at a rate of 0·075 mL/kg ideal bodyweight per h (equivalent to 15 μg salbutamol per kg ideal bodyweight per h).
PMC3266479|S64|Interventions|The patient was measured from heel to vertex with a soft tape measure, and the ideal bodyweight and infusion rate obtained from the conversion table.17
PMC3266479|S65|Interventions|If any patient developed a tachycardia (heat rate >140 beats per min), new arrhythmia, or lactic acidosis, we adjusted the infusion rate according to a prespecified dose-adjustment schedule.15
PMC3266479|S66|Interventions|Infusion of the study drug was stopped at 7 days, or earlier if clinically indicated.
PMC3266479|S68|Outcomes|The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, defined as death up to the end of calendar day 28 after randomisation.
PMC3266479|S69|Outcomes|Secondary outcomes were mortality in the intensive-care unit or hospital before first discharge; ventilator-free and organ failure-free days from randomisation to day 28; length of stay in intensive-care unit and hospital; and tachycardia, new arrhythmia, or other side-effects sufficient to stop treatment with trial drug.
PMC3266479|S70|Outcomes|We defined ventilator-free days as the number of calendar days after patients started unassisted breathing until day 28 after randomisation for patients who survived at least 48 consecutive hours after start of unassisted breathing.20
PMC3266479|S71|Outcomes|The number of ventilator-free days was zero for patients who died without start of unassisted breathing or before 48 consecutive hours of unassisted breathing.20
PMC3266479|S72|Outcomes|We defined organ failure-free days as the number of days in the first 28 days after randomisation that the patient received no cardiovascular, renal, liver, or neurological support as defined by the Critical Care Minimum Dataset.21
PMC3266479|S73|Changes to Outcomes|We did not plan to collect data for cause of death in the original trial protocol; however, after early termination of the trial because of the increased 28-day mortality in the salbutamol group, the data for the main cause of death were ascertained for all participants dying within 28 days of randomisation.
PMC3266479|S74|Changes to Outcomes|We requested causes of death as recorded on the death certificate for the disorder directly leading to death.
PMC3266479|S75|Outcomes|Patients who remained alive and in critical care after randomisation were monitored daily until discharged to a ward, or until day 28.
PMC3266479|S77|Sample Size Determination|We based the sample-size calculation on our BALTI trial13 and on 2005 data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre.
PMC3266479|S78|Sample Size Determination|The target sample size of 1334 gave 90% power at p<0·05 to detect a risk ratio (RR) of 0·8 for 28-day mortality between the salbutamol and placebo groups with a 3% loss of patients for the primary outcome, with the assumption that the 28-day mortality in the placebo group was 44%.
PMC3266479|S79|Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|We planned interim analyses every 12 months, or more frequently if requested by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee.
PMC3266479|S80|Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|The committee used the Haybittle-Peto22 stopping guideline: a difference of three standard errors would be needed before considering recommending trial cessation for benefit at an interim analysis.
PMC3266479|S81|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|All analyses were based on intention-to-treat analyses.
PMC3266479|S82|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We compared the primary outcome and other dichotomous outcomes using RRs and 95% CIs.
PMC3266479|S83|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We compared continuous outcomes with mean differences and their 95% CIs.
PMC3266479|S84|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We analysed 28-day mortality with survival analysis, and by comparison of the two groups with hazard ratios and 95% CIs and the Kaplan–Meier curve.
PMC3266479|S85|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|All reported p values are two-sided and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
PMC3266479|S86|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We used prespecified subgroup analyses to investigate the effects of age, severity of hypoxaemia at study entry, cause (direct vs indirect causes of ARDS), and the APACHE II mortality risk, on the effect of salbutamol.
PMC3266479|S87|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|All subgroup analyses used interaction tests; we either calculated the ratio of RRs between the subgroups, or used interaction terms in logistic regression models.
PMC3266479|S88|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We did a post-hoc analysis for the main causes of death as recorded on the death certificates of participants who died within 28 days of randomisation.
PMC3266479|S89|Registry/Number|This trial is registered, ISRCTN38366450 and EudraCT number 2006-002647-86.
PMC3266479|S91|Funding|The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
PMC3266479|S94|Data Collection Setting|46 study sites participated in recruitment; a further 25 sites obtained approval to start the trial, but were unable to do so before recruitment was stopped.
PMC3266479|S95|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up,Trial Stopping|Recruitment was stopped after the second interim analysis, when the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee reviewed the results for 273 patients in March, 2010.
PMC3266479|S96|Outcome Results|The RR for the primary outcome at this time was 1·55 (95% CI 1·07–2·24).
PMC3266479|S97|Trial Stopping|Therefore, the committee recommended suspension of recruitment to BALTI-2 because of a significant (p=0·02) adverse effect of salbutamol on 28-day mortality, and the 99·8% CI excluded a benefit for salbutamol of the size anticipated in the protocol.
PMC3266479|S98|Trial Stopping|Infusion was discontinued in all patients (one receiving salbutamol, two receiving placebo) receiving study drug at that time.
PMC3266479|S99|Trial Stopping|The trial steering committee endorsed this recommendation and closed recruitment on March 23, 2010.

PMC3266479|S101|Participant Flow|Figure 1 shows the trial profile.
PMC3266479|S102|Participant Flow|326 patients were randomly assigned to receive either salbutamol or placebo.
PMC3266479|S103|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Two patients withdrew consent; no outcome data were available for these patients.
PMC3266479|S104|Participant Loss and Exclusion|The study drug was not given to two patients in the salbutamol group: one patient needed a β blocker between randomisation and starting the drug, the other patient's next of kin refused to have a separate intravenous line inserted for infusion after initially giving consent.

PMC3266479|S109|Baseline Data|Table 1 Baseline characteristics
PMC3266479|S110|Baseline Data|Both groups had similar baseline characteristics (table 1).
PMC3266479|S111|Baseline Data|The median time from randomisation to start of the study infusion was similar in both groups (salbutamol 1·3 h, IQR 0·6–2·5; placebo 1·1 h, 0·6–2·2).
PMC3266479|S112|Outcome Results|Patients in the salbutamol group were more likely to have their infusion stopped early than were those in the placebo group, either because of death (14/161 vs eight of 163), or the development of significant side-effects (47/161 vs 13/163).
PMC3266479|S113|Ancillary Analyses|The duration of infusion was on average 24·5 h (95% CI 12·3–36·7) shorter in the salbutamol group than in the placebo group (mean 114·1 h [SD 62·7] vs 138·6 h [47·9]; figure 2).
PMC3266479|S114|Outcome Results|The risks of patients developing a tachycardia, new arrhythmia, or lactic acidosis severe enough to warrant stopping of the study drug were substantially higher in the salbutamol group than in the placebo group (table 2).

PMC3266479|S118|Outcome Results|Survival analysis of the primary outcome (figure 3) showed a hazard ratio of 1·56 (95% CI 1·03–2·36).
PMC3266479|S119|Outcome Results|Salbutamol resulted in a 10·9% (95% CI 1·0–20·4) absolute increase in 28-day mortality (table 2).
PMC3266479|S120|Outcome Results|One additional death occurred for every 9·2 (95% CI 4·9–100·9) patients with ARDS given salbutamol.
PMC3266479|S121|Outcome Results|The number of deaths before discharge from either intensive-care unit or hospital did not differ significantly between groups (p=0·10 and p=0·26, respectively; table 2).
PMC3266479|S122|Outcome Results|We noted an 8·4% (95% CI −1·7 to 18·3) absolute increase in intensive-care unit mortality and a 6·0% (−4·4 to 16·2) increase in hospital mortality in the salbutamol group (table 2).
PMC3266479|S123|Outcome Results|Ventilator-free and organ failure-free days in the first 28 days after randomisation were both reduced in the salbutamol group (table 2).
PMC3266479|S124|Outcome Results|We detected no clear differences between the groups in length of stay in intensive-care units and hospitals (table 2).
PMC3266479|S125|Outcome Results|Surviving patients with ARDS in the salbutamol group needed a mean of 3·4 more days (95% CI −0·3 to 7·1) in intensive-care units than did those in the placebo group (table 2).
PMC3266479|S126|Harms|Serious adverse events (other than those recorded as trial outcomes, eg, death) were reported for 13 participants (nine in salbutamol group, four in placebo group).
PMC3266479|S127|Harms|Four of these events were thought to be related to the study drug infusion, and only one was an unexpected effect.
PMC3266479|S128|Ancillary Analyses|Subgroup analyses did not suggest that the effects of salbutamol were modified by any of the variables investigated.
PMC3266479|S129|Ancillary Analyses|For cause (categorical subgrouping variable), the ratio of RRs was 0·96 (95% CI 0·46–2·01).
PMC3266479|S130|Ancillary Analyses|For continuous variables the ratios of odds ratios for each variable investigated were 0·97, 0·93–1·00; p=0·07 for age; 1·02, 0·92–1·14; p=0·66 for severity of hypoxemia; and 1·29, 0·08–22·04; p=0·86 for mortality risk.
PMC3266479|S131|Interpretation|The analysis suggested weak evidence of a possible interaction effect with age.
PMC3266479|S132|Interpretation|However, the effect was small and strongly affected by the oldest age stratum (>85 years), in which there were only four patients; therefore, this finding is likely to be due to chance.
PMC3266479|S133|Ancillary Analyses|Adjustment for baseline variables (age, sex, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and cause) alone or in combination made no substantial difference to the estimate of the treatment effect of salbutamol or its statistical significance (data not shown).
PMC3266479|S134|Ancillary Analyses|We obtained data for cause of death for 91 of 93 patients who died by day 28 (55/55 in the salbutamol group, 36/38 in the placebo group).
PMC3266479|S135|Ancillary Analyses|Because of the diversity of individual diagnoses, we grouped results for cause of death according to organ system.
PMC3266479|S136|Ancillary Analyses|Diagnoses for the respiratory system were the most common primary cause of death in both groups (28 [51%] patients given salbutamol vs 20 [53%] given placebo), followed by multiorgan failure (12 [22%] vs 14 [37%]).
PMC3266479|S137|Ancillary Analyses|ARDS was recorded on the death certificate for 11 (21%) patients in the salbutamol group, and eight (21%) in the placebo group.
PMC3266479|S152|Interpretation|The effects on ventilator-free days and mortality in ALTA were consistent with those in BALTI-2, but our trial shows clearly that intravenous administration of salbutamol at 15 μg/kg ideal bodyweight per h to patients with early ARDS was poorly tolerated, is unlikely to be beneficial, and could worsen outcomes.
PMC3266479|S153|Interpretation|Routine use of β-2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS cannot be recommended.
PMC3266479|S154|Interpretation|Our findings show that intravenous salbutamol given to patients with early ARDS significantly increased 28-day mortality, and reduced ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days compared with those given placebo.
PMC3266479|S155|Interpretation|Treatment was poorly tolerated because of tachycardia, arrhythmias, and lactic acidosis.
PMC3266479|S156|Interpretation|These findings were unexpected; however, they have clarified whether intravenous infusion of β-2 agonists should be used in patients with ARDS (panel).
PMC3266479|S159|Generalizability|Because we recruited a large number of ARDS patients, with characteristics similar to other multicentre trials,2,23 from 46 multidisciplinary intensive-care units in the UK, our data could be generalised to other intensive-care units.
PMC3266479|S161|Limitations|First, mortality in the placebo group was much lower than anticipated.
PMC3266479|S162|Interpretation|This outcome could have been caused by changes in the mortality of ARDS because of improvements in treatments.24
PMC3266479|S163|Limitations|Second, because of the nature of pragmatic trials, we did not obtain prospective data for cardiovascular comorbidity and causes of deaths, including results of post-mortem.
PMC3266479|S164|Limitations|These data could provide useful information about possible explanations of these unexpected trial results.
PMC3266479|S165|Limitations|Third, the trial was stopped at a smaller sample size than was planned; therefore, the precision of the treatment effect estimates is lower than expected.
PMC3266479|S166|Interpretation|A large sample size and narrow CIs might clarify salbutamol's effects on secondary outcomes, such as mortality rates in intensive-care units and hospitals.
PMC3266479|S167|Limitations|Fourth, although we recommended best practice for ARDS (protective ventilation, conservative fluid management), we did not measure details of clinical management.
PMC3266479|S170|Limitations|The dose is at the high end of the manufacturer's recommended dosing regimen; as such, a beneficial effect of salbutamol could have been outweighed by its adverse effects at this dose.
PMC3266479|S171|Limitations,Interpretation,Generalizability|A lower dose of salbutamol might have produced a different outcome, so the conclusions from our study can relate only to the dose given.
PMC3266479|S172|Interpretation|The mechanisms underlying the increased mortality in the salbutamol group remain unclear.
PMC3266479|S173|Interpretation|That the survival curves for salbutamol and placebo seem to continue to diverge after the end of the salbutamol infusion might be notable, so the mechanism could be complex.
PMC3266479|S175|Interpretation|Adverse effects on the cardiovascular system—eg, tachyarrythmias, cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction—could have been harmful.26,27
PMC3266479|S176|Interpretation|Recruitment of damaged alveoli28 and activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system could adversely affect pulmonary fluid balance.29
PMC3266479|S177|Interpretation|Findings from this multicentre trial provide evidence that intravenous salbutamol in the early course of ARDS was poorly tolerated, is unlikely to be beneficial, and could worsen outcomes.
PMC3266479|S178|Interpretation|Routine use of β-2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS cannot be recommended.

PMC3070271|S2|Title (Randomized)|A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (ANAJIS trial)
PMC3070271|S5|Structured Abstract|To assess the efficacy of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist anakinra in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).
PMC3070271|S20|Registry/Number|Trial Registration Number: NCT00339157.
PMC3070271|S28|Background|In particular, serum samples from patients with SJIA induce IL-1β transcription on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra leads to the normalisation of a disease-specific gene expression profile.6 7
PMC3070271|S29|Background|Non-controlled pilot studies provide evidence of dramatic, quick responses to anakinra in a subgroup of patients with SJIA.6 8–10
PMC3070271|S31|Objective|We therefore designed a trial aiming at assessing the efficacy of anakinra treatment, and its effect on blood gene expression profiling, in patients with SJIA displaying active systemic disease despite corticosteroid treatment.
PMC3070271|S34|Data Collection Setting|This was a multicentre trial including six centres.
PMC3070271|S35|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion criteria were age 2–20 years, a diagnosis of SJIA,1 more than 6 months' disease duration, active systemic disease (disease-related fever and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) >20 mg/l and/or first hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >20) and significant overall disease activity at day 1 (D1) (at least three of the following criteria: (1) physician global assessment of disease activity ≥20/100; (2) parent/patient assessment of disease effect on overall wellbeing ≥20/100; (3) Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire score ≥0.375/3; (4) ≥2 joints with active arthritis; (5) ≥2 joints with non-irreversible limited range of motion and (6) ESR ≥30) despite oral prednisone or prednisolone ≥0.3 mg/kg or 10 mg/day (whichever was lower).
PMC3070271|S36|Eligibility Criteria|Female subjects entering the study were prepubescent, sexually inactive or required to use effective contraception.
PMC3070271|S37|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with an IL-1 inhibitor or any condition contraindicating immunosuppressive treatment.
PMC3070271|S42|Trial Design|Part 1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase.
PMC3070271|S43|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Interventions,Randomization Type|At D1, eligible patients were randomised to receive either anakinra or placebo (1:1) from D1 to month 1 (M1) using a computer-generated random list.
PMC3070271|S44|Randomization Type|Patients were stratified by centres and randomisation was balanced across treatments and centres.
PMC3070271|S46|Blinding Procedure|Investigators, other caregivers, the patients and their parents remained blinded to the assigned treatment.
PMC3070271|S47|Outcomes|The primary objective was to demonstrate a higher proportion of responders in group 1 than group 2.
PMC3070271|S55|Trial Design,Interventions|Part 2 was an open-label treatment period: all patients received anakinra after M1.
PMC3070271|S56|Interventions|Tapering the dose of corticosteroids was allowed after the M1 visit (reduction of 0.4–0.5 mg/kg monthly for daily doses of ≥1.5 mg/kg, 0.3–0.4 mg/kg for doses between 1 and 1.5 mg/kg, 0.2–0.3 mg/kg between 0.6 and 1 mg/kg, 0.1–0.2 mg/kg between 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg, ≤0.10 mg/kg for doses <0.3 mg/kg).
PMC3070271|S57|Outcomes|Measurement of serum amyloid A (SAA) and ferritin levels and the percentage of glycosylated ferritin were performed at D1, M1 and M6.
PMC3070271|S58|Outcomes|Total ferritin concentration was measured on a Dimension RXL HM according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Dade Behring, Paris, France).
PMC3070271|S59|Outcomes|Glycosylated ferritin was determined according to the method of Worwood et al,11 with minor modifications as previously described.12
PMC3070271|S60|Outcomes|Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were performed on blood taken at M2 and M6.
PMC3070271|S61|Outcomes|Concentrations of anakinra in plasma samples were determined using the antibody (Ab) ELISA purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).
PMC3070271|S62|Outcomes|Patients who were naive from anti-pneumococcal immunisation received Pneumo23 immunisation at D1 in order to assess at M1 and M12 the effect of anakinra treatment on anti-pneumococcal Ab response to five capsular polysaccharides.13
PMC3070271|S64|Outcomes|Blood samples were collected in Tempus tubes (ABI, Foster City, California, USA) from the patients at D1, M1 and M6 and from age and gender-matched healthy controls.
PMC3070271|S67|Outcomes|In this study, RefSeq IDs were used to match probes between the Affymetrix U133 platform, which was used to generate the original set of modules using PBMC expression data,14 and Illumina Hu6 platform, which was used to hybridise whole blood samples from patients enrolled in this study and healthy controls.
PMC3070271|S69|Outcomes|Illumina modules containing <10 genes were not included in the analysis.
PMC3070271|S71|Outcomes|Serum samples were analysed using the cytokine assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
PMC3070271|S73|Interventions,Outcomes|The primary objective was to compare the efficacy after 1 month's treatment with anakinra (2 mg/kg subcutaneously daily, maximum 100 mg) or placebo in the two groups of patients.
PMC3070271|S74|Outcomes|To be responders to a modified American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACRpedi) 30 score built for the purpose of the trial, patients had to fulfil the three following conditions: (1) ACRpedi 30 response15; (2) absence of disease-related fever (body temperature <38°C over the past 8 days) and (3) 50% decrease compared with D1 or normalisation of both CRP and ESR values.
PMC3070271|S75|Outcomes|Modified ACRpedi 30, 50, 70 and 100 responses, assessed throughout the study, included an improvement of 30%, 50%, 70% or more and 100% respectively, in at least three of the six core criteria for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and a worsening of 30 or more in no more than one of the criteria.
PMC3070271|S76|Outcomes|The criteria were the physician's global assessment of disease activity and the patient's or the parents' global assessment of overall wellbeing, the number of joints with active arthritis, the number of joints with limited range of motion, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire and ESR.15
PMC3070271|S77|Outcomes|A disease flare was defined as either (1) a reoccurrence of disease-related fever or any systemic symptom, or (2) an increase by twofold of either the ESR or CRP value, or (3) a worsening of ≥30% in at least three of the six ACRpedi core criteria and an improvement of ≥30% in no more than one of the criteria.
PMC3070271|S78|Outcomes|If the number of joints with active arthritis was used as a criterion of flare and the patient initially had no active joints or only one active joint, an increase in the number of joints with active arthritis to at least two was required.
PMC3070271|S79|Outcomes|We also aimed to assess the number of patients who reached M6 with inactive disease, as defined by Wallace et al16 under a daily dose of predniso(lo)ne <0.3 mg/kg or 10 mg, whichever was lower.
PMC3070271|S80|Outcomes|Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.
PMC3070271|S81|Outcomes|Specific procedures were set up for serious AEs (SAEs).
PMC3070271|S82|Registry/Number|This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT00339157).
PMC3070271|S85|Sample Size Determination|Given a 5% type I error, a 20% type II error and a two-sided Fisher exact test, 12 patients per group were required.
PMC3070271|S86|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|An intention-to-treat analysis was retained.
PMC3070271|S87|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|To explore whether each variable from the ACRpedi score, CRP, SAA and/or parent/patient assessment of pain were associated with response to treatment, the ratio (value at inclusion − value at M1)/value at inclusion, was compared in both groups.
PMC3070271|S88|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Qualitative and quantitative data were compared using Wilcoxon test and Fisher exact test, respectively.
PMC3070271|S92|Participant Flow|Twenty-seven patients were screened for entry into the study; 24 were eligible for randomisation (figure 2A).
PMC3070271|S93|Baseline Data|Demographic and disease characteristics are summarised in table 1.

PMC3070271|S97|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Arthritis activity leading to treatment withdrawal (= two patients withdrawn for a disease flare-up, at M2 and M3, respectively, and two patients withdrawn for a lack of response, at M4 and M5, respectively).
PMC3070271|S98|Participant Loss and Exclusion|*Two patients from the control group stopped treatment after 5 and 11 days, respectively, owing to pain from injections and were withdrawn from the trial after the M1 visit.
PMC3070271|S102|Baseline Data|Table 1 Patients characteristics at study treatment onset
PMC3070271|S105|Outcome Results|Eight of 12 patients (67%) in group 1 and only 1 of 12 (8%) in group 2 were responders at M1 (p=0.003), therefore the primary objective of the trial was met.
PMC3070271|S106|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Two patients from the control group stopped treatment after 5 and 11 days, respectively, owing to pain from injections and were withdrawn from the trial after the M1 visit; one of them, a child who presented a marked disease flare at D1, was the only responder at M1 in the control group.
PMC3070271|S107|Outcome Results|There was a significant difference in favour of group 1 in the number of joints with active disease, physician general assessment of disease activity, CRP, ESR and SAA values at M1 compared with D1 (table 2).
PMC3070271|S108|Outcome Results|Table 2 Responses at month 1
PMC3070271|S109|Ancillary Analyses|A univariate analysis to explore whether any covariable might be associated with the response at M1 according to the treatment group failed to find any association.
PMC3070271|S112|Harms|Fourteen AEs were recorded in group 1 and 13 in group 2 (table 3).There were no SAEs.
PMC3070271|S113|Harms|Table 3 Adverse events (AEs)
PMC3070271|S115|Ancillary Analyses|At M1, the levels of postvaccination Abs against five pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide serotypes were not significantly different between the two groups.
PMC3070271|S116|Ancillary Analyses|In group 1, 11 patients adequately responded to all serotypes and the 12th patient had a normal response to three of the five serotypes (online supplementary table S1).
PMC3070271|S118|Numbers Analyzed|Samples from 21 patients were included in these analyses, as blood from two patients was not properly collected and one patient was eventually diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
PMC3070271|S120|Outcome Results|Analyses of blood from 21 patients with SJIA and 21 controls at D1 showed the differential expression of 986 transcripts (supplementary figure S1A and table S2).
PMC3070271|S121|Outcome Results|Among those, some of the most highly upregulated encode proteins involved in innate immunity activation, including (1) signalling components of the IL-1, IL-18 and Toll-like receptors (IL-1R2, IL-18RAP, IRAK3, TLR5, PGLYRP1), (2) inflammasome (CARD12/IPAF) and (3) anti-bacterial defence/inflammation (DEFA1, BPI, MPO ELA2, CD163 and several members of the S100 family).
PMC3070271|S122|Outcome Results|Downregulated transcripts encode proteins involved in antigen presentation, lymphocyte lineage and signalling, as well as RNA processing/splicing and DNA modification (supplementary figure S1B and table S2).
PMC3070271|S123|Outcome Results|Cytokine transcripts encoding IL1-β and IL-6 were not differentially expressed, but oncostatin (OSM) and the negative regulator of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) transcripts were upregulated.
PMC3070271|S125|Outcome Results|At M1, 522 transcripts were significantly changed in patients treated with anakinra but not in the placebo-treated group (supplementary table S3).
PMC3070271|S126|Outcome Results|We found a significant upregulation of the purinergic receptor P2RX7, an ATP-gated ion channel involved in IL-1β processing and secretion,17 HLA-class II genes, the proteasome activator PSME2 and transcripts involved in interferon (IFN) signalling (SOCS1, STAT1 and STAT2).
PMC3070271|S127|Outcome Results|IL-1B was among the most significantly downregulated transcripts.
PMC3070271|S130|Outcome Results|At D1, patients from both groups displayed fairly homogeneous modular expression patterns with significant upregulation of innate immunity and underexpression of adaptive immunity modules.
PMC3070271|S131|Outcome Results|Modules including myeloid linage (M1.5 and M2.6), neutrophil (M2.2) and inflammation (M3.2 and 3.3) related transcripts were upregulated.
PMC3070271|S132|Outcome Results|Modules associated with erythrocytes (M2.3) and platelets (M1.2) were also upregulated.
PMC3070271|S133|Outcome Results|Conversely, modules containing transcripts related to lymphoid/T-cell lineage (M2.8 and M3.8), B cells (M1.3), T cells (M1.4) and cytotoxic cells (M2.1) were downregulated.
PMC3070271|S134|Outcome Results|At M1, several modular alterations were corrected in the anakinra-treated patients who responded to treatment (figure 3).
PMC3070271|S136|Outcome Results|The modular alterations corrected in responders include transcripts within the platelet (M1.2), cytotoxic (M2.1) and erythropoiesis (M2.3) modules.
PMC3070271|S137|Outcome Results|None of these modules changed in the placebo group, therefore supporting the validity of the data at D1.
PMC3070271|S138|Outcome Results|We also observed the coordinated upregulation of type I IFN-inducible transcripts (M3.1) in the anakinra- but not in the placebo-treated group.
PMC3070271|S153|Numbers Analyzed|Twenty-two patients entered the second phase of the study (figure 2B).
PMC3070271|S155|Ancillary Analyses|PK analyses revealed a trend towards lower anakinra concentrations at M2 and M6 in patients with lower weight and those who had failed to respond to anakinra after 1 month (residual anakinra concentration of 45.5 ± 51 ng/ml (range 20–122) vs 136.5 ± 106 ng/ml (range 20–353) in responders), but overall this difference was not significant.
PMC3070271|S164|Harms|Six patients developed a SAE.
PMC3070271|S165|Harms|Four infections and one vertebral collapse had a favourable outcome and these five patients continued the trial; one patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease shortly after M2 and withdrawn from the trial.
PMC3070271|S167|Harms|Other AEs mainly consisted of non-severe injection-site reactions and common infections (table 3).
PMC3070271|S168|Harms|One patient stopped anakinra owing to a sudden increase in serum transaminases at M6.
PMC3070271|S170|Ancillary Analyses|At M12, 12 patients were tested and an adequate Ab response was maintained in all cases (supplementary table S1).
PMC3070271|S172|Outcome Results|Expression of more than 500 transcripts changed significantly in the six patients who responded to anakinra at M6 (supplementary table S5).
PMC3070271|S173|Outcome Results|The modular analysis of responders at M6 (n=6) showed the normalisation of 11/13 original modular alterations, while non-responders still showed altered expression of 12 of them (figure 3A).
PMC3070271|S174|Outcome Results|Interestingly, overexpression of type I IFN-inducible genes (module 3.1) was observed in every group after initiation of anakinra treatment (both at M1 and M6) regardless of the clinical response (figure 3B).
PMC3070271|S175|Outcome Results|To support the validity of the transcriptional data, we measured the protein levels of two IFN-inducible proteins (IP10 and TRAIL) and found that they were significantly increased in the serum of anakinra-treated patients at M6 (figure 3C).
PMC3070271|S176|Outcome Results|Accordingly, SOCS3 expression, which could explain the cross-regulation of IL-1β and type I IFN, was downregulated in the majority of patients at M6 (figure 3D).
PMC3070271|S180|Interpretation|The efficacy of anakinra treatment in SJIA, at least in the short term, concorded with previous reports.6 8–10
PMC3070271|S181|Interpretation|However, the only other placebo-controlled trial testing anakinra in JIA showed no significant improvement versus placebo,18 illustrating that marked response to IL-1 inhibition is not characteristic of all JIA subtypes.
PMC3070271|S183|Interpretation|First, most patients had diffuse polyarthritis at enrolment but no fever; as previously reported,9 anakinra seemed less effective on the arthritis than on systemic features.
PMC3070271|S184|Interpretation|Second, PK data suggested that low-weight children might have benefited from a higher anakinra dosage.
PMC3070271|S185|Interpretation|Third, we included patients with active SJIA, steroid-dependency and a minimal disease duration of 6 months, therefore difficult to treat5; loss of responses may have been favoured by the study design that precluded the use of associated DMARDs and allowed tapering of the corticosteroid dose at an early stage, a strategy designed to minimise the risk of treatment-related complications.
PMC3070271|S186|Limitations|This study has limitations owing to the small number of patients and the short duration of the double-blind phase.
PMC3070271|S187|Limitations|In particular, we were unable to properly assess which patients' characteristics might predict response to treatment.
PMC3070271|S211|Interpretation|In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with SJIA responded to IL-1 blockade as dramatically as patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, confirming a key role for IL-1 in a wide spectrum of diseases.30

PMC3002766|S2|Title (Randomized)|Bosentan treatment of digital ulcers related to systemic sclerosis: results from the RAPIDS-2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
PMC3002766|S4|Structured Abstract|Objectives
PMC3002766|S23|Background|Patients with SSc are at high risk for the development of ischaemic digital ulcers (DUs), which occur in 35% to 60% of patients with SSc2–5 and are an important source of morbidity.
PMC3002766|S38|Background|A previous double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigated the role of bosentan in the reduction of new DUs in 122 patients with SSc and a history of DUs within the previous year.16
PMC3002766|S40|Objective|The present study (RAPIDS-2, for ‘RAndomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled study with bosentan on healing and prevention of Ischemic Digital ulcers in patients with systemic Sclerosis’) was designed to further investigate the effects of bosentan as a treatment for DUs secondary to SSc over a 24-week treatment period in a larger population of patients, all of whom had active DUs at study entry.
PMC3002766|S41|Objective|The primary objectives were to evaluate the effect of bosentan on the reduction of new DUs and healing of DUs in patients with SSc.
PMC3002766|S42|Objective|Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of bosentan on pain and disability, as well as its tolerability and safety in these patients.
PMC3002766|S45|Trial Design|This double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study consisted of a ≤2-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period and an 8-week post-treatment follow-up period.
PMC3002766|S49|Data Collection Setting,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|The study was conducted from October 2003 to May 2005 at 41 centres in Europe and North America.
PMC3002766|S50|Eligibility Criteria|Recruited patients were ≥18 years old, with SSc as defined by the preliminary classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)17 and at least one active DU (onset between 1 week and 3 months prior to randomisation) that was selected by the investigator and termed the ‘cardinal ulcer’ (painful area, ≥2 mm in diameter with visible depth and loss of dermis, amenable to healing and in a location judged compatible with a vascular aetiology, specified by protocol as volar surface of the digit distal to the proximal interphalangeal digital crease).
PMC3002766|S51|Eligibility Criteria|Patients were excluded if they had received intravenous prostanoids within the previous 3 months, had used phosphodiesterase inhibitors other than for intermittent treatment of male erectile dysfunction, or had received inhaled or oral prostanoids or injected botulinum toxin in an affected finger within 1 month.
PMC3002766|S52|Eligibility Criteria|Patients were also excluded if they received systemic antibiotics to treat infected DUs within 2 weeks prior to randomisation.
PMC3002766|S53|Eligibility Criteria|Also excluded were patients with body weight <40 kg, severe PAH (WHO class III/IV), moderate to severe hepatic impairment or serum aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN).
PMC3002766|S56|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Randomization Type|After screening, patients were randomised to bosentan or placebo (1:1 ratio) by sequential allocation of randomisation numbers distributed to each centre in blocks of four.
PMC3002766|S57|Interventions|Patients received bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then 125 mg twice daily for the remainder of the treatment period or matching placebo.
PMC3002766|S58|Interventions|The dose could remain at or be decreased to the starting dose due to intolerance, with possible subsequent increase to the target dose.
PMC3002766|S59|Interventions|Concomitant use of systemic antibiotics, analgaesics and topical treatments for wound care were allowed, and randomised treatment was administered in addition to the usual, stable (over the previous month) treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon.
PMC3002766|S60|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Patients who required parenteral, oral or inhaled prostanoid treatment during the study were first discontinued from study treatment.
PMC3002766|S63|Outcomes|The two primary end points were (1) the mean number of new DUs per patient assessed by the investigator up to week 24 and (2) the time to healing of the cardinal ulcer up to week 24 in patients with cardinal ulcer healing maintained for 12 or more weeks.
PMC3002766|S64|Outcomes|Healing was defined as complete epithelialisation, regardless of residual pain.
PMC3002766|S65|Outcomes|Maintenance of cardinal ulcer healing required no recurrence at or contiguous to the original location at week 24 (if healing occurred before or at week 12) or during 12 weeks of observation with permissible extension of the treatment period (if healing occurred after week 12).
PMC3002766|S67|Outcomes|Secondary and exploratory end points included: (1) reduction of new DUs and overall DU number (proportions of patients with no new DUs and with each number of new DUs up to week 24, time to onset of each number of new DUs up to week 24 and change from baseline to week 24 in total number of all DUs), (2) healing (time to healing of all baseline DUs and of all new DUs through week 24, and proportions of patients with healing of all DUs by the end of week 24) and (3) pain and disability parameters (changes from baseline to week 24: in pain of the cardinal ulcer and overall hand pain assessed on visual analogue scales; hand disability index (an averaged score from the three Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) domains of dressing/grooming, grip and hygiene); and HAQ disability index18 19).
PMC3002766|S68|Outcomes|Post hoc analyses included: (1) the number of new DUs up to week 12 in the overall patient population and in subgroups defined by randomisation month (October–February or autumn–winter and March–September or spring–summer) and (2) number of new DUs, time to each successive new DU and total number of DUs through week 24 in subgroups defined by the number of DUs at baseline (<4 and ≥4).
PMC3002766|S72|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Efficacy analyses were performed on all treated patients using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
PMC3002766|S73|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Means±SEs are presented for numerical variables and Kaplan–Meier estimates for time-to-event variables.
PMC3002766|S74|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Treatment effects for the primary end points were evaluated using the Pitman permutation (new DUs) and log-rank test with asymptotic approximation (time to healing of the cardinal ulcer).
PMC3002766|S75|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Missing data on new DUs were imputed using extrapolation, with the incidence rate of new DUs at the last assessment corrected for the missing time period.
PMC3002766|S78|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Treatment effects for new DUs in predefined subgroups were presented as point estimates and 95% two-sided CIs.
PMC3002766|S79|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|For exploratory purposes, statistical tests of treatment difference were provided for planned secondary/exploratory and unplanned post hoc efficacy analyses and included the Pitman permutation (for changes from baseline), the Fisher exact test (for proportions) and the log-rank test (for times to event), each performed without correction for multiple testing.
PMC3002766|S80|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Placebo-corrected changes from baseline, RR and HRs from Cox modelling were each reported with 95% CIs where appropriate.
PMC3002766|S83|Baseline Data|The two treatment groups were well matched with respect to demographic features, baseline disease characteristics and concomitant treatment for DUs at baseline (table 1).
PMC3002766|S84|Participant Flow|All 188 randomised patients received study treatment, with mean exposures of 22.7±0.9 and 24.5±0.9 weeks in the bosentan and placebo groups, respectively.
PMC3002766|S85|Participant Loss and Exclusion,Participant Flow|The treatment period was completed by 75/98 (76.5%) and 73/90 (81.1%) patients, respectively (figure 1), with 9.2% and 7.8%, respectively, discontinued due to an adverse event.

PMC3002766|S87|Baseline Data|Table 1 Demographics and baseline characteristics of the study population
PMC3002766|S90|Outcome Results|After 24 weeks of bosentan treatment there was a 30% reduction in the occurrence of new DUs compared with placebo in the study population (1.9 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) vs 2.7 (2.0 to 3.4) new DUs, p=0.0351, figure 2).
PMC3002766|S91|Outcome Results,Ancillary Analyses|Fewer new DUs were observed with bosentan than placebo in all subgroups except among current smokers (table 2, subgroup analyses).
PMC3002766|S92|Outcome Results,Ancillary Analyses|This included subgroups of limited and diffuse SSc, with no difference between the two subgroups in the treatment effect (overlapping 95% CIs).

PMC3002766|S98|Outcome Results|No difference between bosentan and placebo treatments was observed in the time to healing of the cardinal ulcer (HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.35), p=0.63, figure 3).
PMC3002766|S99|Outcome Results|At week 24, more than 50% of patients in both groups had healing of the cardinal ulcer maintained for at least 12 weeks.
PMC3002766|S100|Outcome Results|Figure 3 Kaplan–Meier estimates of time to complete healing of the cardinal ulcer.
PMC3002766|S103|Outcome Results|The proportion of patients with no new DUs up to week 24 was similar with bosentan and placebo (observed in 32/95 (33.7%) and 26/89 (29.2%) patients, respectively, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.77); p=0.53).
PMC3002766|S104|Outcome Results|The proportion of patients with one or more new DU was 66.3% (63/95) on bosentan compared with 70.8% (63/89) on placebo; the difference in observed proportions between treatments was greater in patients with multiple new DUs (18.9% vs 29.2% with ≥4, 10.5% vs 29.8% with ≥5, etc; figure 4).
PMC3002766|S105|Outcome Results|The maximum number of new DUs per patient was 10 on bosentan and 16 on placebo.
PMC3002766|S106|Outcome Results|Time-to-event analyses up to week 24 indicated an increasing reduction in risk with bosentan compared with placebo for the appearance of each successive new DU, with a HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.95, p=0.03) for the fifth new DU.
PMC3002766|S107|Outcome Results|However, the mean total number of DUs (baseline and new) per patient decreased to a similar extent in the bosentan and placebo groups (−1.7.
PMC3002766|S108|Outcome Results|(95% CI −2.3 to −1.0) and −1.5 (−2.3 to −0.7) DUs, respectively; p=0.76).

PMC3002766|S110|Outcome Results|Patients in the placebo group had up to 16 new DUs.
PMC3002766|S112|Outcome Results|No treatment effects were observed in the times to healing up to week 24 for all baseline DUs (HR 0.94 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.37), p=0.74) or of all new DUs (HR 1.40 (0.78 to 2.51), p=0.26).
PMC3002766|S113|Outcome Results|Healing of all DUs (baseline and new combined) at week 24 was observed in 35/95 (36.8%) and 35/89 (39.3%) of patients on bosentan and placebo, respectively (RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.35), p=0.76).
PMC3002766|S115|Outcome Results|Patient-rated measures of overall hand pain and pain of the cardinal ulcer, as assessed by visual analogue scales, showed no differential treatment effect in pain at week 24 (mean treatment effects of −1.7 (95% CI −11.4 to 7.9), p=0.73 and −1.6 (−11.5 to 8.3), p=0.75, respectively).
PMC3002766|S116|Outcome Results|The changes from baseline in the HAQ disability index and hand disability index at week 24 were also similar in both treatment groups (−0.04 (95% CI −0.15 to 0.08), p=0.51 and −0.04 (−0.20 to 0.12), p=0.62, respectively).
PMC3002766|S118|Ancillary Analyses|In unplanned post hoc analyses in subgroups defined by the number of DUs at baseline, the mean treatment effect with bosentan was −2.1 (95% CI −3.8 to −0.4) new DUs (p=0.02) in patients with at least four DUs at baseline and −0.3 (−1.1 to 0.4) new DUs (p=0.39) in patients with less than four DUs at baseline (table 2).
PMC3002766|S119|Ancillary Analyses|In both subgroups, the estimated proportion of patients without each subsequent new DU was larger in the bosentan than placebo group except the first new DU (table 3), and the difference between treatment groups was larger among patients with at least four new DUs than in those with fewer than four new DUs.
PMC3002766|S120|Ancillary Analyses|No difference between treatments was observed in the mean total number of DUs (baseline plus new) per patient among patients with at least four DUs at baseline (−3.4 (95% CI −4.8 to −1.9) on bosentan and −3.6 (−5.4 to −1.7) DUs on placebo) and those with fewer than four DUs at baseline (−0.6 (−1.0 to −0.2) and −0.5 (−1.1 to 0.1) DUs, respectively).
PMC3002766|S121|Ancillary Analyses|Table 3 Kaplan–Meier estimates of patients without subsequent new DUs at week 20 by number of DUs at baseline
PMC3002766|S122|Ancillary Analyses|An analysis of subgroups based on randomisation month (October–February, March–September) confined to the first 12 weeks of treatment (to avoid overlapping time periods) found no effect of season on the treatment effect (table 2).
PMC3002766|S124|Harms|Serious adverse events occurred in 9.4% and 16.7% of patients on bosentan and placebo, respectively (table 4), with only one serious event (pneumonia) reported for more than one patient on bosentan.
PMC3002766|S125|Harms|One patient on placebo died from acute respiratory distress syndrome during the post-treatment follow-up.
PMC3002766|S127|Harms|Adverse events occurring in more patients on bosentan than placebo included peripheral oedema (18.8% vs 4.4%) and events denoting elevated aminotransferases (12.5% vs 2.2%).
PMC3002766|S130|Harms|Laboratory tests identified increased aminotransferases to >3×ULN in 10/95 (10.5%) patients on bosentan (which included one patient with an elevation to >8×ULN) and 1/88 (1.1%) patients on placebo.
PMC3002766|S132|Harms|Table 4 Summary of adverse events occurring during and up to 1 day after the end of study treatment
PMC3002766|S139|Interpretation|Consistent with the first trial, the observed treatment effect was greater in patients with multiple DUs, while there was no effect on healing parameters.16
PMC3002766|S140|Interpretation|The reduction of new DUs without effect on healing in bosentan-treated patients did not translate into a smaller ulcer burden, as was seen in the previous study.16
PMC3002766|S141|Interpretation|In this study, similar reductions in the overall number of DUs (present at baseline and/or new) occurred in both groups.
PMC3002766|S146|Interpretation|The reduction of new DUs with bosentan also did not translate into measurable decreases in pain or disability compared with placebo.
PMC3002766|S147|Interpretation|Explanations could include (1) the expected result, given no differences in total number of DUs between treatment groups, (2) a lack of sensitivity to change and discriminative value in the current instruments used to assess hand function in SSc and (3) bosentan treatment does not improve pain and disability in spite of the reduction of new DUs.
PMC3002766|S149|Interpretation|A clear picture of the overall benefits of treatment on patient well-being remains elusive, as remaining DUs and the underlying healing rate may confound overall assessments.
PMC3002766|S151|Interpretation|The increased incidence of elevated aminotransferases with bosentan in this and other studies reinforces the need for continual monitoring of liver function with this treatment.
PMC3002766|S155|Limitations|The definition of an active DU used in this trial may not match criteria used in other centres.
PMC3002766|S156|Limitations|The clinical utility of this promising approach to treatment may be challenged.
PMC3002766|S158|Interpretation|However, in those patients presenting with multiple DUs (at least four), the effect of bosentan treatment on the reduction of new DUs offers greater potential benefit.
PMC3002766|S159|Generalizability|Major outcomes including hospitalisations for infection or need for surgical amputation occur too infrequently to serve as outcome measures in trials of this sort, but it seems reasonable to surmise that reduced occurrence of DUs would ultimately reduce the risk of same in an appropriate population.
PMC3002766|S160|Interpretation|In conclusion, two randomised trials have shown that bosentan treatment reduces the occurrence of new DUs compared with placebo in patients with SSc but has no effect on DU healing.
PMC3002766|S161|Interpretation|Bosentan was well tolerated and may be a useful adjunct in the management of patients with SSc and recurrent DUs.

PMC3109952|S2|Title (Randomized)|Cryotherapy versus salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts (verrucae): a randomised controlled trial
PMC3109952|S4|Structured Abstract|Objective To compare the clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy versus salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts.
PMC3109952|S17|Registry/Number|Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN18994246, National Research Register N0484189151.
PMC3109952|S25|Background|A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effects of different local treatments of cutaneous, non-genital warts and highlighted considerable uncertainty around the optimal treatment.6
PMC3109952|S35|Background|A major conclusion from the review was that a trial comparing topical salicylic acid with cryotherapy was urgently needed.
PMC3109952|S36|Objective|We therefore conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of 50% salicylic acid and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen.
PMC3109952|S38|Trial Design,Data Collection Setting|This multicentre, two arm, randomised, controlled, open trial was carried out in 13 centres in the United Kingdom and one in the Republic of Ireland.
PMC3109952|S40|Eligibility Criteria|Participants were eligible for the study if they were aged 12 years or over and had a plantar wart (verruca) that, in the opinion of a healthcare professional, was suitable for treatment with both salicylic acid and cryotherapy.
PMC3109952|S41|Eligibility Criteria|Participants were excluded from the study if they had impaired healing (such as from diabetes or peripheral vascular disease); were immunosuppressed (such as agammaglobulinaemia) or were taking immunosuppressant drugs (such as oral corticosteroids); had neuropathy; were receiving renal dialysis; had cold intolerance (such as Raynaud’s syndrome or cold urticaria); had any of the following conditions (blood dyscrasias of unknown origin, cryoglobulinaemia, cryofibrinogenaemia, collagen or autoimmune disease); were unable to give informed consent; or were currently in a trial evaluating other treatments for their plantar wart.
PMC3109952|S46|Allocation Concealment Mechanism,Randomization Implementation|Randomisation was performed by a member of the research team either telephoning an independent, secure, remote, telephone randomisation service (York Trials Unit) or accessing a secure online web randomisation programme, thereby concealing treatment allocation until the moment of randomisation.
PMC3109952|S47|Randomization Type,Random Allocation Sequence Generation|Randomisation was simple (that is, it was not restricted in any way such as by stratification or blocked allocation with the allocation sequence being computer generated).
PMC3109952|S50|Interventions|Participants randomised to cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen received a maximum of four treatments given two to three weeks apart by a healthcare professional.
PMC3109952|S51|Interventions|The liquid nitrogen was applied with a spray (method of choice if available) or a probe.
PMC3109952|S52|Interventions|The treatment was delivered according to the site’s usual practice (such as debridement before treatment, masking of the surrounding area, and padding after treatment).
PMC3109952|S53|Interventions|On advice from the trial steering committee, sites were advised that the first treatment should be a “gentle freeze” in order to ensure the participant could tolerate the treatment.
PMC3109952|S55|Interventions|Participants randomised to self treatment with 50% salicylic acid (Verrugon, William Ransom and Son) were instructed how to apply the treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions by the treating healthcare professional.
PMC3109952|S56|Interventions|Patients were directed to fix the adhesive ring with the hole over the verruca and to squeeze a little ointment into the hole and directly on to the verruca.
PMC3109952|S57|Interventions|The backing paper from the plaster was then removed and the plaster applied to cover the ring completely.
PMC3109952|S58|Interventions|The plaster was then sealed into position.
PMC3109952|S59|Interventions|The treatment was repeated daily after gently pumicing or filing off the dead part of the verruca for a maximum of eight weeks.
PMC3109952|S62|Outcomes|The primary outcome was complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after randomisation.
PMC3109952|S63|Outcomes|Clearance of plantar wart was defined as the restoration of normal skin on close inspection.
PMC3109952|S64|Outcomes|Digital photographs of the plantar wart(s) were taken at baseline and at the outcome assessment.
PMC3109952|S65|Outcomes,Blinding Procedure|The photographs were assessed by two assessors who were blind to treatment allocation.
PMC3109952|S66|Outcomes|They independently assessed the photographs for each participant to determine whether the plantar wart had cleared.
PMC3109952|S67|Outcomes|Any discrepancies were referred to a third assessor.
PMC3109952|S68|Outcomes|If no photographs were available for a participant, however, then the blinded outcome assessment undertaken at the site was used.
PMC3109952|S69|Outcomes|If neither of these were available for a participant, the patient’s self reported outcome recorded in the week 12 patient questionnaire or on the “Verrucae gone form” was used.
PMC3109952|S71|Outcomes|Secondary outcomes included (a) complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after controlling for age, whether the plantar wart had been treated previously, and type of wart and (b) a second model to explore the effect of patient preferences, (c) with clearance of plantar wart at six months, (d) number of warts at 12 weeks, (e) time to clearance of wart, (f) patient satisfaction with the treatment, and (g) adverse events.
PMC3109952|S72|Outcomes|Questionnaires were administered by post or were completed on line at one, three, and 12 weeks and six months.
PMC3109952|S79|Sample Size Determination|In order to give 80% power (5% two sided significance) to show a difference in cure rates of 70% for salicylic acid versus 85% for cryotherapy at 12 weeks, a sample size of 120 patients in each treatment group was required, or 133 patients in each group after allowing for 10% attrition (266 patients in total).
PMC3109952|S82|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, NC, USA) and SPSS version 17.0.2 (SPSS) using two sided significance tests at the 5% significance level for the primary outcome measure and 1% significance level for secondary outcome measures.
PMC3109952|S84|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The primary analysis compared the clearance rate of all plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two randomised groups using a χ2 test.
PMC3109952|S85|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Cohen’s κ measure of inter-rater agreement was used to assess agreement between the two assessors of the photographs for clearance.
PMC3109952|S87|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|A logistic regression model was used to adjust the primary analysis for important prognostic variables (age, whether the plantar wart had been previously treated, and type of wart).
PMC3109952|S88|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We also extended the primary outcome model to explore the effect of patient preferences by including preference and an interaction term between preferred treatment and randomised treatment.
PMC3109952|S89|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The complete clearance of all plantar warts at six months was analysed in the same way as the primary outcome with adjustments for the same covariates.
PMC3109952|S90|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We used negative binomial regression to compare the number of plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two treatment groups with adjustment for the number of plantar warts at baseline.
PMC3109952|S92|Outcomes|The time to clearance of plantar warts was derived as the number of days from randomisation until the date of clearance, as detailed from the participant’s self reported questionnaire.
PMC3109952|S94|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the time to clearance of plantar warts between the two groups adjusting for the same covariates as for the primary outcome.
PMC3109952|S95|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The Cox proportional hazard assumption was tested globally by the correlation of Schoenfeld residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time) and separately for each covariate through the correlation of Schoenfeld scaled residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time).
PMC3109952|S99|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up,Participant Flow|Between November 2006 and January 2010, 284 individuals were screened as potential participants, and 242 (85%) were randomised—124 to salicylic acid and 118 to cryotherapy.

PMC3109952|S116|Numbers Analyzed|In total, 229 participants had a response for whether there was complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after randomisation, with 206 (90%) having a blinded outcome assessment: 159 (69%) had a blinded outcome assessment from a digital photograph (cryotherapy=80, salicylic acid=79), 47 (21%) had a blinded outcome assessment from a healthcare professional (cryotherapy=22, salicylic acid=25), four (2%) had an unblinded outcome assessment from a healthcare professional (cryotherapy=1, salicylic acid=3), and 19 (8%) had patient self assessment (cryotherapy=7, salicylic acid=12).
PMC3109952|S117|Binary Outcome Results|Overall, 32 of the 229 (14%) had complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks, corresponding to 17/119 (14%) patients in the salicylic acid group and 15/110 (14%) patients in the cryotherapy group, with no significant difference between the two groups (difference 0.65% (95% confidence interval –8.33 to 9.63), P=0.89).
PMC3109952|S118|Binary Outcome Results|Cohen’s κ measure, used to assess the agreement between the two assessors of the photographs, was estimated to be 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.55), which indicates a moderate level of agreement.
PMC3109952|S119|Binary Outcome Results|The assessors disagreed in 51 cases: in three cases the disagreement was between whether the plantar wart was “cleared” or “not cleared,” in five cases it was between “cleared” and “unable to assess,” and in the remaining 43 cases it was between “not cleared” and “unable to assess.”
PMC3109952|S123|Binary Outcome Results|Logistic regression analysis showed no evidence of a difference between the salicylic acid and cryotherapy groups (odds ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.11), P=0.92 which favours the salicylic group).
PMC3109952|S125|Binary Outcome Results|Overall, 62 (32%) of the patients had complete clearance of all plantar warts at six months—29/95 (31%) of patients in the salicylic acid group and 33/98 (34%) in the cryotherapy group, with no significant difference between the groups (difference –3.15% (–16.31 to 10.02), P=0.64).
PMC3109952|S126|Binary Outcome Results|The findings from the adjusted analysis were similar to those of the unadjusted analysis (odds ratio 1.17 (0.62 to 2.21), P=0.62).
PMC3109952|S127|Outcome Results|The median number of plantar warts at 12 weeks in the salicylic acid group was two (range 0–20) and in the cryotherapy group was one (0–40), and no significant difference between the two groups (incident rate ratio 1.08 (0.81 to 1.43), P=0.62).
PMC3109952|S128|Outcome Results|The number of plantar warts at the start of the study was not found to be an important predictor of outcome (odds ratio 0.81 (0.65 to 1.01)).
PMC3109952|S130|Ancillary Analyses|There was no evidence of a difference in the time to clearance between cryotherapy and salicylic acid in the Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio 0.80 (0.51 to 1.25), P=0.33).
PMC3109952|S131|Ancillary Analyses|The proportional hazard assumption was tested and not violated, either separately for each covariate (cryotherapy v salicylic acid (P=0.3107), age (P=0.9508), type of plantar wart (P=0.7024), previous treatment (P=0.4456)) or globally (P=0.8208).
PMC3109952|S135|Outcome Results|There was a significant association between patient satisfaction with treatment and randomised treatment at each of the three time points (Fisher’s exact test P=0.0336 for week 1, P=0.0020 for week 3, P=0.0065 for week 12).
PMC3109952|S136|Outcome Results|At week 1, more patients were happy with salicylic acid than cryotherapy but also more patients were very happy with cryotherapy than salicylic acid.
PMC3109952|S137|Outcome Results|At week 3, more patients were unhappy with salicylic acid than with cryotherapy (none), and more patients were very happy with cryotherapy than salicylic acid.
PMC3109952|S138|Outcome Results|At week 12, more patients were unhappy with salicylic acid than with cryotherapy, and more were very happy with cryotherapy than with salicylic acid.
PMC3109952|S148|Harms|In the cryotherapy group, there were two treatment related, non-serious adverse events in two participants.
PMC3109952|S149|Harms|Both participants developed a blister that was larger than expected in routine practice.
PMC3109952|S153|Interpretation|We compared the clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and 50% salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts and found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness.
PMC3109952|S154|Interpretation|However, cryotherapy was associated with higher costs per cured patient, which leads to salicylic acid being a more attractive treatment.
PMC3109952|S160|Interpretation|This difference in cure rate could be attributed to different populations recruited to the study.
PMC3109952|S171|Generalizability|This is typical of the characteristics of patients presenting to healthcare professionals for treatment, so we can be confident that these results are broadly generalisable and that the study has external validity across the UK and Ireland.
PMC3109952|S173|Limitations|Firstly, our sample size was powered to show a 15% difference in effectiveness, with cure rates of 70% for the salicylic acid treatment and 85% for the cryotherapy.
PMC3109952|S175|Limitations|Secondly, it has been suggested that a six month follow-up is a more realistic time point at which to assess the success of treatments of cutaneous warts than shorter time frames.6
PMC3109952|S179|Limitations|In this study neither treatment was very effective with only 17/119 (14%) in the salicylic acid group and 15/110 (14%) in the cryotherapy group having complete clearance of plantar warts at 12 weeks, but the lack of a no treatment arm in this study means we cannot compare these cure rates with the natural resolution rate.
PMC3109952|S180|Limitations|Finally, participants allocated to the salicylic acid group were advised to self treat for a maximum of eight weeks, but we collected patient self reported data on adherence to treatment only at one and three weeks after randomisation.
PMC3109952|S182|Limitations|However, data collected by the healthcare professionals about the total amount of acid applied during the course of the trial (mean amount applied 2.8 g) could suggest a lower adherence for the treatment period overall.
PMC3109952|S183|Limitations|For some deep seated plantar warts, this might not have been sufficient to clear the wart.
PMC3109952|S186|Interpretation|We found no evidence that cryotherapy is more effective than patient self treatment with 50% salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts.
PMC3109952|S192|Limitations|This trial found no evidence of a difference in the cure rates between the two treatments, but, as this trial was assessed as being of low quality, we cannot rule out the possibility that different cure rates might be achieved with different strengths of acid.
PMC3109952|S193|Interpretation|It is therefore possible that cryotherapy is a superior treatment against lower concentrations of salicylic acid.
PMC3109952|S194|Limitations|Nor did we evaluate the effectiveness of salicylic acid treatment if delivered by a healthcare professional.

PMC3386495|S2|Title (Randomized)|The benefits and harms of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 6 h of acute ischaemic stroke (the third international stroke trial [IST-3]): a randomised controlled trial
PMC3386495|S5|Structured Abstract|Thrombolysis is of net benefit in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, who are younger than 80 years of age and are treated within 4·5 h of onset.
PMC3386495|S10|Registry/Number|The study is registered, ISRCTN25765518.
PMC3386495|S22|Funding|UK Medical Research Council, Health Foundation UK, Stroke Association UK, Research Council of Norway, Arbetsmarknadens Partners Forsakringsbolag (AFA) Insurances Sweden, Swedish Heart Lung Fund, The Foundation of Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg, Polish Ministry of Science and Education, the Australian Heart Foundation, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Swiss National Research Foundation, Swiss Heart Foundation, Assessorato alla Sanita, Regione dell'Umbria, Italy, and Danube University.
PMC3386495|S26|Background|Thrombolytic therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), when approved in Europe, was restricted to the treatment of patients younger than 80 years of age with acute ischaemic stroke who could be treated within 3 h.
PMC3386495|S30|Background|Older people have been under-represented in stroke trials in general,8 and in stroke thrombolysis trials in particular (only 79 people aged older than 80 years had been included in trials of rt-PA).6
PMC3386495|S32|Objective|The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), therefore, had the following objectives: to establish the balance of benefits and harms of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in patients who did not exactly meet the licence criteria (especially elderly patients); determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit from this treatment; assess which categories of patients were most likely to benefit by investigating possible interactions between treatment effect and various factors (including age, stroke severity, and early brain imaging results); refine current estimates of the duration of the therapeutic time window; and to improve the external validity and precision of the existing estimates of the overall treat-ment effects (benefits and harms).
PMC3386495|S33|Objective|The primary trial hypothesis was that 0·9 mg/kg rt-PA (maximum 90 mg) given to adult patients of all ages with acute ischaemic stroke, within 6 h of symptom onset, increased the proportion of people who were alive and independent at 6 months.
PMC3386495|S36|Trial Design|IST-3 was a pragmatic10 international, multicentre, randomised-controlled, open-treatment trial.
PMC3386495|S37|Blinding Procedure,Trial Design|The initial pilot phase was double-blinded and placebo-controlled.
PMC3386495|S38|Changes TO Trial Design|At the end of the pilot phase, since the main phase compared treatment with open control, several additional measures were introduced to minimise bias in the assessment of early and late outcomes.11
PMC3386495|S40|Eligibility Criteria|The eligibility criteria can be summarised in terms of the uncertainty principle.15–17
PMC3386495|S41|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in detail in the protocol.13
PMC3386495|S42|Eligibility Criteria|Briefly, patients were eligible according to the following criteria: they had symp-toms and signs of clinically definite acute stroke; the time of stroke onset was known; treatment could be started within 6 h of onset; and CT or MRI had reliably excluded both intracranial haemorrhage and structural brain lesions, which could mimic stroke (eg, cerebral tumour).
PMC3386495|S43|Eligibility Criteria|Additionally, if the patient had a clear indication for intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA, they were to be treated in accordance with local guidelines.
PMC3386495|S44|Eligibility Criteria|Equally, if the patient had a clear contraindication to treatment they were not to be entered in the trial.
PMC3386495|S45|Eligibility Criteria|Only if both the clinician and the patient (or a relevant proxy for the patient) felt that the treatment was promising but unproven, could the patient be included in the trial after appropriate informed consent from the patient or a valid proxy.
PMC3386495|S47|Registry/Number|This study is registered, ISRCTN25765518.
PMC3386495|S49|Baseline Data|Table 1 Baseline characteristics
PMC3386495|S50|Randomization Implementation|Clinicians entered baseline data via a telephone voice-activated or a secure web-based randomisation system.
PMC3386495|S51|Randomization Implementation|After the system had recorded and checked the data, patients were allocated either immediate thrombolysis with 0·9 mg/kg of intravenous rt-PA to a maximum of 90 mg (10% bolus with the remainder over 1 h) or control treatment.
PMC3386495|S52|Eligibility Criteria|The system would not accept patients with blood pressure or glucose levels outside protocol-defined criteria (appendix pp 4–5) or other data inconsistencies.
PMC3386495|S53|Randomization Implementation|The system used a minimisation algorithm to achieve optimum balance for key prognostic factors (table 1), and from January, 2006, minimisation was additionally stratified by world region and then minimised on all the other key factors within regions.
PMC3386495|S57|Interventions|Patients allocated to the control group were to avoid treatment with rt-PA and received stroke care in the same clinical environment as those allocated to the rt-PA group.
PMC3386495|S58|Interventions|Both treatment groups had blood pressure monitored closely over the first 24 h.
PMC3386495|S59|Interventions|In the double-blinded phase, both groups were to avoid antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for 24 h.
PMC3386495|S60|Interventions|In the open phase, patients allocated to the control group were to start aspirin immediately.
PMC3386495|S63|Outcomes|All patients had a CT or MRI brain scan before randomisation and a follow-up scan at 24–48 h.
PMC3386495|S64|Outcomes|A repeat brain scan was required if the patient deteriorated neurologically or intracranial haemorrhage was suspected for any reason.
PMC3386495|S65|Outcomes|Although CT scanning was preferred, MRI was allowed.
PMC3386495|S66|Outcomes,Blinding Procedure|All scans were sent to the trial centre in Edinburgh for masked central rating of any signs of visible early ischaemia (presence and extent of hypo-attenuation, swelling, hyperattenuated artery), haemorrhage, and background brain changes (leukoaraiosis, atrophy, prior stroke lesions, non-stroke lesions) with validated rating methods.20–25
PMC3386495|S67|Blinding Procedure,Outcomes|Images were assessed with all original identifiers stripped from the record, and then viewed via a secure web-based image viewing system by an international panel of expert radiologists.
PMC3386495|S68|Blinding Procedure|All assessments were made masked to all patient details and treatment allocation.
PMC3386495|S69|Outcomes|The primary outcome specified in version 1·93 of the protocol and in the published statistical analysis plan14 was the proportion of patients alive and independent as measured by the Oxford Handicap Score (OHS),26 a commonly used variant of the modified Rankin score.27
PMC3386495|S70|Outcomes|Patients with an OHS of 0, 1, or 2 were classed as independent.
PMC3386495|S71|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The statistical analysis plan specified an ordinal analysis of the OHS score at 6 months.
PMC3386495|S73|Outcomes|Events occurring within 7 days of stroke were recorded by the local trial clinician on the 7-day form: deaths subdivided by cause (swelling of the initial infarct, intracranial haemorrhage, other deaths from the initial stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, recurrent stroke of unknown type, any other cause); symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage; recurrent ischaemic stroke; recurrent stroke of unknown type; neurological deterioration attributed to swelling of the initial ischaemic stroke; neurological deterioration not attributable to swelling of the initial ischaemic stroke or haemorrhage; and major extracranial haemorrhage (operational definitions of each of these events are provided in the published protocol13 and statistical analysis plan14).
PMC3386495|S74|Outcomes|Other fatal and non-fatal non-cerebral events were also recorded and coded.
PMC3386495|S75|Blinding Procedure|Data on potential reports of any of these events were extracted from the trial database and presented to the adjudication committee who were masked to treatment allocation.
PMC3386495|S77|Random Allocation Sequence Generation|To avoid predictable alternation of treatment allocation, and thus potential loss of allocation concealment, patients were allocated with a probability of 0·80 to the treatment group that would minimise the difference between the groups on the key prognostic factors.
PMC3386495|S78|Random Allocation Sequence Generation|Additional details of the procedures used in the double-blinded phase of the study are reported elsewhere.11
PMC3386495|S79|Randomization Implementation|The randomisation system informed local clinicians of the patients' unique trial identification number, and the weight-adjusted dose of drug or placebo in the double-blinded phase, or of the weight-adjusted drug dose among those allocated thrombolysis in the open phase, to be given as a 10% bolus with the remainder by an infusion over 1 h.
PMC3386495|S80|Blinding Procedure|With the exception of the 276 patients treated in the double-blinded phase of the trial, treatment was given openly and neither the patient nor the treating clinicians were masked.
PMC3386495|S81|Outcomes|Hospital staff completed an early outcome form at 7 days, death, or hospital discharge, whichever occured first, recording details of events occurring in hospital within 7 days, details of background treatments given and functional status.
PMC3386495|S82|Outcomes|6 months after randomisation, general practitioners (or hospital coordinators) were contacted by the IST-3 trial office staff to check that the patient was alive and inform them that they might be approached for follow-up.
PMC3386495|S83|Blinding Procedure,Outcomes|If appropriate, the IST-3 trial office masked staff then mailed a postal questionnaire to patients to assess outcome.
PMC3386495|S84|Outcomes|Non-responders were contacted by telephone, and follow-up data was obtained by telephone interview.
PMC3386495|S85|Outcomes,Blinding Procedure|In Italy and Austria, all follow-ups were done as telephone interviews by a clinician, who was masked to treatment allocation and was highly experienced in outcome assessment.
PMC3386495|S86|Outcomes,Blinding Procedure|In Portugal, patients were followed up in clinic by clinicians not involved in the patients' initial treatment, again, masked to treatment allocation as far as possible.
PMC3386495|S87|Outcomes|To assess the durability of any treatment benefit beyond 6 months, patients recruited in the UK (and in other countries where appropriate funding had been obtained) were also followed up at 18 months.
PMC3386495|S88|Outcomes|All follow-up done by patient contact for these analyses ceased on March 31, 2012, but recording of deaths from national registries of deaths continues in UK, Norway, and Sweden.
PMC3386495|S90|Sample Size Determination|At the outset of the trial in 2000, we estimated that, among the type of patients likely to be recruited at the time, to detect both an absolute difference of 10% in the proportion of patients alive and independent at 6 months after treatment and to have sufficient power to permit reliable analyses of the prespecified subgroups, a sample of 6000 patients would be needed.
PMC3386495|S91|Sample Size Determination|A trial of that size could detect a clinically worthwhile net benefit of as little as 3% absolute difference in the primary outcome (80% power, α=0·05).
PMC3386495|S92|Changes TO Trial Design|However, it was clear by 2007 that obtaining a sample of 6000 was no longer feasible, and the Steering Committee agreed a revised recruitment target.11
PMC3386495|S93|Sample Size Determination|The sample size, re-estimated in 2007 on the basis of event rates in both treatment groups combined, was 3100.
PMC3386495|S94|Sample Size Determination|This sample size gave 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 4·7% in the primary outcome.11
PMC3386495|S100|Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|The independent data monitoring committee met at least annually to review the unmasked data on major outcome events in the trial, on the background stroke-unit care received by trial patients (to ensure it was equal in both treatment groups), relevant external data (including updates of the Cochrane systematic review and reports from large-scale registries of rt-PA use) in strict confidence throughout the course of the trial.
PMC3386495|S101|Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|The committee judged these data never met the protocol-specified criteria to recommend modification of the protocol or halt recruitment to the study.
PMC3386495|S102|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The statistical analysis plan was published14 before unmasking of the authors to the data.
PMC3386495|S103|Numbers Analyzed|All randomly assigned patients were included in the analysis.
PMC3386495|S105|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Therefore, the primary analysis of the effect of treatment on the primary outcome was adjusted by logistic regression for linear effects for the following covariates: age; National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score; time from onset of stroke symptoms to randomisation; and presence (vs absence) of ischaemic change on the prerandomisation brain scan according to expert assessment.
PMC3386495|S106|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|An unadjusted analysis is also presented.
PMC3386495|S110|Changes to Outcomes,Changes TO Trial Design|We therefore specified in the statistical analysis plan an ordinal logistic regression analysis, as a secondary outcome, in which the OHS as a dependent variable had 5 levels: levels 4, 5, and 6 were combined into a single level and levels 0, 1, 2, 3 were retained as distinct.
PMC3386495|S111|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|In this model the treatment odds ratios between one level and the next were assumed to be constant, so a single parameter summarises the shift in outcome distribution between treatment and control groups.
PMC3386495|S112|Outcomes|For patients known to be alive at 6 months, but with an unknown OHS, we used the level of function recorded on the 7-day form (ie, measured at 7 days or before discharge from hospital) to impute 6-month functional status.14
PMC3386495|S119|Participant Flow|Figure 1 Trial profile
PMC3386495|S124|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up,Participant Flow|Between May, 2000, and July, 2011, 3035 patients were enrolled in 156 centres in 12 countries.
PMC3386495|S125|Baseline Data|Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups (figure 1, table 1).
PMC3386495|S126|Baseline Data|1617 (53%) patients were older than 80 years of age.
PMC3386495|S129|Baseline Data|Additional baseline characteristics are shown in appendix pp 2–3.
PMC3386495|S130|Participant Flow|Of those assigned to the rt-PA group, 26 (2%) did not receive any rt-PA treatment, and of those assigned to the control group, seven (<1%) received at least some rt-PA.
PMC3386495|S131|Ancillary Analyses|Among patients allocated to the rt-PA group, the mean time from randomisation to injection of the bolus was 18 min, the mean time from onset to treatment was 4·2 h (SD 1·2), median 4·2 h (IQR 3·2–5·2).
PMC3386495|S134|Ancillary Analyses|However, the proportion of those who had spent at least 1 day in a high-dependency area was somewhat higher among patients assigned to the rt-PA group than in the control group (328 [24%] vs 237 [17%]), though in both groups, the median stay in such an area was just 1 day.
PMC3386495|S135|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|76 (49%) centres were classed as experienced in treating stroke with thrombolysis, and 1143 patients were recruited by these centres.
PMC3386495|S136|Ancillary Analyses|Patients recruited within 1–2 h of onset were significantly more likely to have a more severe neurological deficit did than those recruited at later timepoints after onset (test for linear trend p<0·0001).
PMC3386495|S137|Ancillary Analyses|Similarly, patients recruited at earlier time points were significantly older than those recruited later (test for linear trend p<0·0001).
PMC3386495|S138|Baseline Data|The proportion of patients with a definitely visible ischaemic lesion (vs only possible or no early ischaemic change) on baseline imaging rose with time (test for linear trend p=0·0045).
PMC3386495|S139|Outcome Results|Figure 2 Outcome at 6 months: Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS) by treatment group
PMC3386495|S140|Outcome Results|For the ordinal analysis, which was adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), delay (all linear), and and presence or absence of visible acute ischaemic change on baseline scan as judged by the expert reader, the statistical analysis plan prespecified that OHS levels 4, 5, and 6 were grouped and 0, 1, 2, 3 remained discrete.
PMC3386495|S141|Outcome Results|In that analysis, the common odds ratio was 1·27 (95% CI 1·10–1·47; p=0·001).
PMC3386495|S142|Outcome Results|An ordinal analysis with OHS levels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all discrete, adjusted in the same way, gave an odds ratio of 1·17 (95% CI 1·03–1·33; p=0·016).
PMC3386495|S144|Outcome Results|Table 2 Estimated group difference for primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months, based on intention-to-treat analysis
PMC3386495|S145|Outcome Results|At 6 months, 554 (37%) in the rt-PA group versus 534 (35%) in the control group were alive and independent in activities of daily living (OHS 0–2; table 2).
PMC3386495|S146|Outcome Results|A secondary ordinal analysis provided evidence of a favourable shift in the distribution of OHS scores at 6 months with treatment (p<0·001; figure 2).
PMC3386495|S147|Binary Outcome Results|More patients died within 7 days in the rt-PA group than in the control group, but between 7 days and 6 months there were correspondingly fewer deaths in the rt-PA group.
PMC3386495|S148|Outcome Results|Table 3 Fatal and non-fatal cerebral and non-cerebral events within 7 days of randomisation
PMC3386495|S149|Outcome Results,Harms|Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and fatal or non-fatal deterioration due to swelling of the infarct within 7 days occurred in more patients in the rt-PA group than in the control group (table 3).
PMC3386495|S150|Outcome Results,Harms|rt-PA was associated with a significant increase in extracranial haemorrhages (table 3).
PMC3386495|S151|Outcome Results|Figure 3 Adjusted effect of treatment on the primary outcome (alive and independent, Oxford Handicap Score 0, 1, or 2) in subgroups
PMC3386495|S152|Ancillary Analyses|The key predefined subgroups were age 80 years or younger, age older than 80 years, time from stroke onset to randomisation (0–3·0 h, 3·0–4·5 h, 4·5–6·0 h), initial stroke severity as measured by National Institutes of Health stroke score, and the appearance of the baseline brain scan on expert read for each subgroup (whether ischaemic change is visible or not).
PMC3386495|S153|Ancillary Analyses|The treatment odds ratio in each subgroup has been adjusted for the linear effects of the other key variables (age, NIHSS, and delay) but not for the presence or absence visible ischaemic change.
PMC3386495|S164|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|To assess the effect of treatment on the primary outcome, the statistical analysis plan predefined a small subset of key prognostic subgroups (figure 3).
PMC3386495|S165|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|The subgroup analyses are of the adjusted effects and take account of the fact that, for a specific prognostic factor, the distribution of other factors might differ between subcategories.
PMC3386495|S168|Ancillary Analyses|Overall, little variation occurred in the adjusted effects of treatment in different subgroups.
PMC3386495|S169|Ancillary Analyses|However, a significant difference did occur in the adjusted effect of treatment between patients older than 80 years and in patients 80 years or younger (p=0·027), suggesting greater benefit in those older than 80 years of age; contrary to expectations.14
PMC3386495|S170|Ancillary Analyses|Treatment appeared at least as effective in this age group as in younger patients.
PMC3386495|S171|Ancillary Analyses|Significant trends towards larger effects of treatment in more severe strokes were also seen (as assessed by the NIHSS and by the predicted probability of a poor outcome18).
PMC3386495|S172|Ancillary Analyses|Benefit was greatest in patients treated within 3 h, but there was insufficient power to examine decay of benefit with time.
PMC3386495|S173|Ancillary Analyses|An analysis of the treatment effect in each of three equal-sized cohorts of patients (ie, those recruited in 2000–06, 2007–08, 2009–11) did not provide any evidence of period effects (data not shown).
PMC3386495|S174|Ancillary Analyses|We also undertook a sensitivity analysis restricted to the 2939 (96%) patients with known 6-month vital and disability status (appendix pp 4–5), and the results were not qualitatively different from those in table 2.
PMC3386495|S176|Interpretation|Although the increase in the number of patients treated with rt-PA who were alive and independent at 6 months was smaller than originally anticipated and was not significant, the secondary analysis provides supportive evidence of benefit.
PMC3386495|S177|Interpretation|The ordinal analysis provided evidence that on average, patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis up to 6 h after stroke survived with less disability.
PMC3386495|S178|Interpretation|At 6 months, vital status was known for most patients and there was no evidence of any difference in the number of deaths, despite the excess of deaths within 7 days of stroke (mainly due to intracranial haemorrhage).
PMC3386495|S179|Interpretation|Since mortality at 6 months was equal in the two groups, and in view of the evidence that the lower the patients' degree of disability at 6 months, the greater their subsequent survival,31 long-term follow-up beyond 6 months is important.
PMC3386495|S181|Interpretation|Since we sought to recruit older patients and patients who did not strictly meet prevailing licence criteria for thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, we anticipated a higher risk of adverse events, chiefly symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.
PMC3386495|S183|Interpretation|Furthermore, applying a similar definition of symptomatic intra-cerebral haemorrhage as in the Cochrane systematic review, the frequency of this disorder within 7 days in IST-3 patients treated with rt-PA (6·8%) was comparable with the 7·3% reported in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke (SITS) registry of 6483 patients treated within licence in routine clinical practice.32
PMC3386495|S185|Interpretation|Reassuringly, despite the different event rates in the control group, for most of the outcomes, there was no clear evidence that the effects of treatment were qualitatively different in IST-3 to those seen in earlier randomised trials, with two exceptions.
PMC3386495|S186|Interpretation|We identified significant trends towards larger effects of treatment in patients with more severe strokes.
PMC3386495|S187|Interpretation|We also anticipated a reduction in fatal and non-fatal neurological deterioration due to swelling of the initial infarct,6 so the clear 17 per 1000 excess was unexpected, and inconsistent with data from previous trials.6
PMC3386495|S189|Interpretation,Limitations|Benefit with treatment was greatest within 3 h, but the analyses did not have sufficient power to define the shape of the relation between benefit and time beyond 3 h.
PMC3386495|S190|Interpretation|The effect of treatment in patients older than 80 years of age was at least as large as in patients younger than 80 years of age.
PMC3386495|S191|Interpretation|A formal test for trend showed a significant difference for greater benefit of rt-PA in patients with increasingly severe strokes.
PMC3386495|S192|Interpretation|However, in view of the overall non-significant benefit for the primary outcome, the significant interactions across subgroups in these analyses should be interpreted with caution.
PMC3386495|S205|Interpretation|By providing estimates on the benefits and harms of treating patients with acute ischaemic stroke outside the current approvals, IST-3 enables clinicians to consider thrombolytic treatment for a wider range of patients, especially those older than 80 years of age.
PMC3386495|S206|Interpretation|The data reinforce the need for further efforts to increase the proportion of all ischaemic strokes treated within 3 h.
PMC3386495|S207|Interpretation|The additional data from IST-3 give greater confidence that mortality is not increased by treatment.
PMC3386495|S208|Interpretation|The implications for ongoing research are that the data strengthen the rationale for the ongoing trials of thrombolysis in patients presenting more than 4·5 h after onset of stroke, and suggest that the imposition of upper age limits on future trials in acute stroke will become harder to justify.
PMC3386495|S209|Limitations|Lyden34 has identified limitations in these data, chiefly that IST-3 recruited only half the number of patients originally intended and so was underpowered for the primary outcome (and more so for the subgroup analyses).
PMC3386495|S210|Limitations|The many changes in the regulatory environment over the course of the trial delayed the approval of the trial in many centres and precluded the participation of several countries and hence was a significant factor in our failing to achieve our original target.11
PMC3386495|S212|Interpretation|The fact that most of the IST-3 patients treated within 3 h were older than 80 years of age (n=726), yet achieved similar benefit to younger patients in NINDS trial, adds to the NINDS trial.
PMC3386495|S213|Limitations|The absence of masking is most relevant for the assessment of the events within 7 days.
PMC3386495|S215|Interpretation|The proportional effect of treatment on fatal and non-fatal events within 7 days was very similar, which perhaps suggest that masking of the assessors was successful.
PMC3386495|S216|Limitations|The self-assessment at 6 months by patients or their carer by postal questionnaire or masked telephone interview was unmasked and so could be subject to reporting bias.34
PMC3386495|S217|Limitations|However, self-reported outcome by patients is necessarily subjective and affected by many things besides knowledge of treatment allocation.
PMC3386495|S218|Interpretation|The subgroup analysis subdivided by trial phase provides some reassurance in that no significant difference was seen in the effect of treatment on the primary outcome in the double-blind phase and the open phase (figure 3).
PMC3386495|S219|Interpretation|The measurement of outcome with OHS at 6 months is different from previous trials that measured the modified Rankin score at 3 months.
PMC3386495|S225|Interpretation|Outcome (other than survival) was not recorded at 3 months, although the proportional effects on death and disability seen at 6 months in IST-3 are comparable with those seen at 3 months in previous trials.
PMC3386495|S226|Limitations|Lyden also comments that the sampling approach to monitoring in IST-3 was less intense than in many commercial studies, and is a potential concern, but also states: “many clinical trialists believe that source verification of some clinical trial data assures safety, accuracy, and validity of the trial data.
PMC3386495|S228|Interpretation|When the results of IST-3 are incorporated into an updated systematic review,35 the estimates of relative treatment effect are broadly compatible with the previous rt-PA trials for each of the main outcomes: alive and independent; death at final follow-up; and fatal intracranial haemorrhage.
PMC3386495|S229|Limitations|Our trial was underpowered to reliably detect important subgroup effects, and so a collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis (the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists Collaboration [STTC]) has been established, which will include data from all the completed intravenous rt-PA trials and will update the previous pooled analysis.7
PMC3386495|S231|Interpretation|For the types of patient recruited in IST-3 (about three quarters of whom were randomised after 3 h, and half of all patients were older than 80 years of age), by 6 months there was evidence that rt-PA improved functional outcome.
PMC3386495|S232|Generalizability,Interpretation|The data add weight to the policy of treating patients as soon as possible, and also justify extending treatment to patients older than 80 years of age.
PMC3386495|S233|Interpretation|The data do not support any restriction of treatment on the basis of stroke severity or the presence of early ischaemic change on the baseline brain scan.
PMC3386495|S234|Interpretation|The data support the need for randomised trials of thrombolysis in selected patients more than 4·5 h after stroke.

PMC3036630|S4|Structured Abstract|Background
PMC3036630|S19|Registry/Number|Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR1283
PMC3036630|S30|Background|Therefore, there is a need for adequate surrogate markers of airway inflammation in COPD.
PMC3036630|S34|Background|Studies in asthma showed that AHR to mannitol is indeed related to the degree of eosinophilic airway inflammation and is sensitive to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids[11-13].
PMC3036630|S37|Objective|We postulated that AHR to mannitol captures eosinophilic airway inflammation in adults with mild to moderate COPD.
PMC3036630|S38|Objective|Our aim was to test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between AHR to mannitol and markers of inflammation in hypertonic saline-induced sputum, blood and exhaled air.
PMC3036630|S39|Objective|As secondary aim, we investigated whether similar relations can be observed when using spontaneously produced sputum during or directly after the mannitol challenge itself.
PMC3036630|S43|Data Collection Setting|Thirty-two patients with mild to moderately severe COPD were included from two respiratory clinics in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
PMC3036630|S45|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion criteria were symptoms of dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, current or ex-smoker with at least 20 packyears of smoking history, postbronchodilator FEV1 >1.5 liter and >50% of predicted value, FEV1/FVC <0.70 and clinically stable for ≥ 4 weeks prior to recruitment.
PMC3036630|S46|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria were (inhaled) steroid therapy or antibiotic treatment or exacerbation or chest infection ≤ 4 weeks prior to recruitment, treatment with β-blockers, respiratory disease other than COPD including known asthma or allergic rhinitis and contra-indications for challenge testing according to international guidelines[15].
PMC3036630|S49|Registry/Number|The study was registered in the Netherlands trial register under NTR 1283, was designed, performed and analysed by the authors, and was not sponsored by others than the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands itself.
PMC3036630|S51|Trial Design|The study had a cross-sectional design with two studies days comprising randomized challenges with hypertonic saline and mannitol (figure 1).
PMC3036630|S52|Interventions|At a separate screening visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria were examined, postbronchodilator (400 μg salbutamol) spirometry was performed and diffusion capacity was measured.
PMC3036630|S53|Participant Flow|Figure 1 Study design.
PMC3036630|S55|Interventions|On one day sputum was induced by hypertonic saline and a venous blood sample was obtained.
PMC3036630|S56|Interventions|On the other day exhaled nitric oxide was measured first, followed by assessment of atopy and mannitol challenge testing.
PMC3036630|S62|Interventions|Mannitol challenge was performed using a commercially available kit (Pharmaxis Ltd; Sydney, Australia) as described by Anderson et al[8].
PMC3036630|S63|Interventions|Patients inhaled sequential doses of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 160 and 160 mg of mannitol via the inhaler.
PMC3036630|S64|Interventions|The test stopped when 15% fall in FEV1 was achieved or the cumulative dose of 635 mg had been administered.
PMC3036630|S65|Outcomes|Response-dose-ratio (RDR) was calculated as the%fall in FEV1 at the last dose, divided by the total cumulative dose mannitol (%fall.mg) in milligrams administered[18].
PMC3036630|S66|Interventions|If a patient had to cough spontaneously during the mannitol challenge, he or she was asked to expectorate.
PMC3036630|S67|Interventions|This sputum was labeled as mannitol-induced sputum.
PMC3036630|S69|Interventions|Prior to sputum induction, patients inhaled 200 μg salbutamol.
PMC3036630|S70|Interventions|Sputum was induced by inhalation of NaCl 4.5% during 3 × 5 min intervals[19].
PMC3036630|S71|Interventions|This sputum was labeled as induced sputum.
PMC3036630|S72|Outcomes|Whole sputum samples were processed according to a protocol that has been validated in our laboratory[20].
PMC3036630|S73|Outcomes|Differential cell counts were expressed as the percentage of non-squamous cells.
PMC3036630|S74|Outcomes|Absolute cell numbers were calculated as (% cell × total cell count)/sputum weight.
PMC3036630|S75|Outcomes|Sputum samples containing >80% non-squamous cells were excluded from analysis.
PMC3036630|S83|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The relationship between AHR to mannitol (RDR) and the markers of airway inflammation were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (rp).
PMC3036630|S86|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, using RDR against eosinophilic vs non eosinophilic COPD (threshold 2.5% sputum eosinophils).
PMC3036630|S87|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Wilcoxon signed rank test and Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare cell counts of the two sputum samples.
PMC3036630|S88|Sample Size Determination|A sample size estimation showed that the detectable value of the correlation (r) under the alternative hypothesis with a sample of 23 patients (n) is between 1-0.55 (power = 0.808; alpha = 0.05).
PMC3036630|S89|Sample Size Determination|Therefore, thirty-two patients were recruited taking into account an expected 10% drop-out rate and a 20% probability of missing or non-valid data.
PMC3036630|S91|Participant Flow|Twenty-eight of the 32 patients completed the study (table 1).
PMC3036630|S92|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Four patients dropped out for reasons of: non-compliance with medication restrictions (n = 1), lost to follow up (n = 1), FEV1 <1.2 litre prior to challenge (n = 1) and inability to perform all techniques necessary to measure lung function (n = 1).
PMC3036630|S94|Participant Flow,Numbers Analyzed|Hypertonic saline-induced sputum was collected in 28 patients and mannitol-induced sputum in 21 patients.
PMC3036630|S95|Baseline Data|Table 1 Patient characteristics I
PMC3036630|S97|Baseline Data|The baseline values for airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammatory markers are presented in table 2.
PMC3036630|S98|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Five hypertonic saline-induced sputum samples were excluded from analyses as a result of >80% non-squamous cells on differential cell counts.
PMC3036630|S99|Outcome Results|There was a significant positive correlation between the degree of AHR to mannitol (RDR mannitol) and eosinophil counts (r = 0.47, p = 0.03, figure 2) per gram hypertonic saline-induced sputum and with IL-8 levels (r = 0.46, p = 0.04).
PMC3036630|S100|Outcome Results|The correlation between RDR mannitol and blood eosinophils was borderline significant (r = 0.38, p = 0.06, figure 2).
PMC3036630|S101|Outcome Results|No other correlations between RDR mannitol and hypertonic saline-induced sputum parameters were found (Table 3).
PMC3036630|S102|Outcome Results|In addition, a significant, positive association between RDR mannitol and the level of FeNO (r = 0.67, p = 0.0002, figure 2) was observed.
PMC3036630|S103|Outcome Results|When using PD15 to mannitol, the correlation coefficients with sputum and blood eosinophils counts were -0.38 (p = 0.09) and -0.43 (p = 0.03), respectively.

PMC3036630|S108|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Two out of 21 sputum samples were excluded from analyses as a result of >80% non-squamous cells on differential cell counts.
PMC3036630|S109|Outcome Results|There were strongly significant positive correlations between RDR mannitol and the absolute and relative numbers of eosinophils and the level of ECP in mannitol-induced sputum (r = 0.71, p = 0.001; r = 0.60, p = 0.008; r = 0.72, p = 0.001, respectively) (Figure 3).
PMC3036630|S110|Outcome Results|In addition, RDR mannitol was related to the levels IL-8 (r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and MPO (r = 0.64, p = 0.007) (Table 3).
PMC3036630|S111|Outcome Results|Figure 3 Correlation AHR to mannitol and the absolute (left) and relative (middle) amount of eosinophils and ECP (right) in mannitol- induced sputum.
PMC3036630|S112|Outcome Results|Inflammatory markers as obtained by hypertonic- and mannitol challenge were generally well correlated (Table 4).
PMC3036630|S113|Outcome Results|The limits of agreement by Bland and Altman analyses for eosinophil counts and log ECP were -5.7-8.6% and -0.73-0.72, respectively.
PMC3036630|S114|Outcome Results|Table 4 Induced sputum total and differential cell count and mediators when collected with hypertonic saline or mannitol (18 paired samples)
PMC3036630|S116|Outcome Results|The overall accuracy of RDR to mannitol for the assessment of eosinophilic or non eosinophilic COPD, described as the area under the ROC curve (Figure 4), was 67% (95% CI, 33.6 to 97.5%) for hypertonic saline- and 80% (95% CI, 47.7 to 112.3%) for mannitol-induced sputum.
PMC3036630|S117|Outcome Results|At RDR of 0.08%fall.mg the sensitivity and specificity for >2.5% eosinophils in hypertonic saline-induced sputum was 50% (95% CI, 11.8 to 88.2%) and 93% (95% CI, 68 to 99.8%), respectively.
PMC3036630|S118|Outcome Results|For mannitol-induced sputum the sensitivity and specificity was 60% (95% CI, 14.7 to 94.7%) and 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100%) respectively (Figure 4).
PMC3036630|S119|Outcome Results|When using a cut-point of 2.0% eosinophils we observed sensitivities of 44% (95% CI, 13.7 to 78.8%) and 43% (95% CI, 9.0 to 81.6%) with specificities of 100% (95% CI, 73.5 to 100.0%) and 100% (95% CI, 71.5 to 100%) for hypertonic saline- and mannitol- induced sputum, respectively.
PMC3036630|S120|Outcome Results|Figure 4 ROC curve.
PMC3036630|S121|Outcome Results|The curve of sensitivity against 100-specificity is based on using reactivity to mannitol, given as RDR values (%fall.mg), to predict eosinophilic COPD (>2.5%) in hypertonic saline (left) and mannitol-induced (right) sputum.
PMC3036630|S126|Interpretation|Our results suggest that mannitol challenge identifies inflammatory subphenotypes in COPD, in particular those patients without eosinophilic inflammation due to the high specificity of the test.
PMC3036630|S127|Generalizability|This may facilitate individualized treatment in COPD.
PMC3036630|S129|Interpretation|These observations extend previous findings in COPD using adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), in which a correlation between AHR to AMP and eosinophils in sputum was observed[24].
PMC3036630|S131|Interpretation|Hence, mannitol challenge appears to provide valuable information on the inflammatory profile in both patients with COPD and asthma.
PMC3036630|S143|Limitations|First, we could not obtain adequate sputum samples in all patients at all time points.
PMC3036630|S144|Limitations|Even though the power of the study was adequate to address the primary objectives, it may not have been adequate to examine our secondary objective.
PMC3036630|S145|Limitations|Second, we can not exclude that our COPD group included patients who also had asthma.
PMC3036630|S146|Limitations|We excluded those with a previous history of asthma, but this may not have sufficed.
PMC3036630|S148|Limitations|Third, the patients needed to stop the inhaled corticosteroids in order to examine unbiased disease markers.
PMC3036630|S149|Limitations|Therefore, the test performance cannot be generalized to COPD patients on inhaled steroids.
PMC3036630|S151|Limitations|Finally, we did not include a second mannitol challenge for examining reproducibility of our results, which is a limitation of our design.
PMC3036630|S157|Interpretation|This may suggest that epithelial cell and neutrophil activity are also involved in determining the airway narrowing to inhaled mannitol in COPD.
PMC3036630|S161|Interpretation|Our results suggest that mannitol responsiveness is a better marker of eosinophilic inflammation than FeNO in COPD.
PMC3036630|S164|Interpretation|Therefore, the success rate of obtaining mannitol-induced sputum may well be improved by adjusting the standard operating procedure of the test.
PMC3036630|S165|Interpretation|Our findings extend a recent study in asthma, showing adequate sputum samples after mannitol challenge[32].
PMC3036630|S168|Interpretation|Our results suggest that mannitol activated eosinophils, neutrophils and epithelial cells.
PMC3036630|S169|Interpretation|Hence, even though AHR to mannitol was associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation, it is likely to be a more pleiotropic stimulus within the airways.
PMC3036630|S173|Interpretation|Our results suggest that mannitol challenge can identify COPD patients without eosinophilic airway inflammation, who not likely to benefit from inhaled steroid therapy[6].
PMC3036630|S175|Generalizability|Therefore, mannitol challenge may qualify as a feasible alternative in the monitoring of anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD.
PMC3036630|S176|Generalizability|The high specificity (100%) in combination with limited sensitivity indicates that mannitol responsiveness is particularly suitable to exclude sputum eosinophilia in COPD.
PMC3036630|S178|Generalizability|Therefore, mannitol responsiveness may support decisions to refrain from inhaled steroid treatment, thereby potentially preventing overtreatment of COPD.
PMC3036630|S185|Generalizability|These finding suggests that mannitol challenge is a candidate for the guidance and monitoring of individualized, anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD, as an alternative to sputum eosinophils.

PMC3348565|S2|Title (Randomized)|Effect on the incidence of pneumonia of vitamin D supplementation by quarterly bolus dose to infants in Kabul: a randomised controlled superiority trial
PMC3348565|S4|Structured Abstract|Background
PMC3348565|S22|Funding|Wellcome Trust and British Council.
PMC3348565|S25|Background|Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia1 and India2 suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children.
PMC3348565|S44|Background,Objective|On the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation,13,14 we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100 000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population.
PMC3348565|S45|Objective|Our secondary hypotheses were that supplementation would reduce all pneumonias (radiologically confirmed or clinically defined), repeat episodes of pneumonia, hospital admissions, and all cause mortality.
PMC3348565|S49|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up,Trial Design|Between Nov 4 and Dec 4, 2008, we did a community based randomised placebo-controlled superiority trial in Kabul, Afghanistan, within the catchment area of the Maiwand Teaching Hospital, which serves an inner-city population.
PMC3348565|S50|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Follow up ended in May, 2009.
PMC3348565|S51|Data Collection Setting|The children we enrolled into our study largely came from five of the 18 socioeconomically deprived inner-city districts.
PMC3348565|S56|Eligibility Criteria|Our inclusion criteria were infants aged 1–11 months and living in our study region.
PMC3348565|S57|Eligibility Criteria|Our exclusion criteria were families expecting to move to another town within 18 months, diagnosis of rickets or treatment with vitamin D in the previous 3 months, and clinical diagnosis of Kwashiorkor or Marasmus.
PMC3348565|S58|Interventions,Randomization Implementation|The fieldworkers obtained written informed consent from the mother, father, or another senior family member before recruitment; allocated the unique identification number (sequentially); and gave the first dose of vitamin D3 or placebo.
PMC3348565|S59|Eligibility Criteria|Children with vomiting were excluded temporarily and enrolled 2 weeks later after recovery.
PMC3348565|S63|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Randomization Type,Randomization Implementation|An independent statistician (Shabbar Jaffar, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK) randomised unique identification numbers individually in fixed blocks of 20 to the vitamin D3 or placebo group by use of a random number generator with the SAS routine.
PMC3348565|S64|Allocation Concealment Mechanism|By use of the randomisation list, a pharmacist in the Department of Pharmacy, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi prepared 100 000 IU (2·5 mg) of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in olive oil (Sinochem Ningbo Laboratory, China) or placebo (olive oil) in sealed 2 mL plastic syringes labelled with the unique identification numbers.
PMC3348565|S65|Blinding Procedure,Similarity of Interventions|The vitamin D3 and the placebo were the same colour (pale yellow), taste, and quantity (0·5 mL) and therefore the study staff and the families did not know to which group the children were assigned.
PMC3348565|S66|Randomization Implementation|Fieldworkers allocated children to randomisation groups during recruitment and gave vitamin D or placebo.
PMC3348565|S68|Interventions|We chose a quarterly supplementation regimen because in routine programme conditions a quarterly regimen is likely to have better adherence than a daily regimen,13,14 and has been shown to be effective at maintaining the serum vitamin D concentration within normal ranges for 2–3 months in a French high-risk infant population.16
PMC3348565|S69|Interventions|The syringes containing vitamin D or placebo were stored in conditions recommended by the manufacturer—a dry cool environment—between 2 and 24 weeks before administration.
PMC3348565|S76|Interventions|All children clinically diagnosed with pneumonia were offered free chest radiographs taken by radiographers trained by a WHO trainer.
PMC3348565|S78|Outcomes|In case of disagreement, radiographs were read by a third independent radiologist and most decisions were accepted.
PMC3348565|S80|Outcomes|We defined clinical pneumonia as a history of cough plus increased respiratory rate for age, chest in-drawing, or any danger sign (ie, not drinking or breastfeeding, convulsion, vomiting, lethargic or unconscious, stridor in a calm child).
PMC3348565|S81|Outcomes|We defined severe pneumonia as cough plus chest in-drawing and very severe diseases as cough plus any danger signs.
PMC3348565|S82|Outcomes|Our primary endpoint was the first episode of pneumonia from the time of enrolment confirmed by chest radiograph (consolidation or infiltrates).
PMC3348565|S83|Outcomes|We defined as a new episode of pneumonia an episode happening 15 days or longer after the first.
PMC3348565|S84|Outcomes|We judged an episode happening within 14 days to be continuation of the previous episode.
PMC3348565|S85|Outcomes|We collected venous blood samples from randomly selected blocks of children on the basis of the assumption that each block had an equal number of children from the vitamin D3 and placebo groups.
PMC3348565|S86|Outcomes|This was to ascertain calcifediol serum concentrations 1 week after giving the first dose in the placebo group (a baseline value for the whole population) as well as early concentrations after the first vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group (70 in placebo and 69 in intervention groups).
PMC3348565|S87|Outcomes|We also collected samples at other times (appendix) from a different set of randomly selected children to check fluctuations in serum concentrations.
PMC3348565|S88|Outcomes|We stored the serum samples at −20°C and analysed them at the end of our study with IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Chemiluminescent assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd, Tyne and Wear, UK) at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK (Supra-Regional Vitamin D Reference Laboratories accredited to ISO9001:2000 and ISO13485:2003 and participating in the Vitamin D Quality Assurance Scheme).
PMC3348565|S90|Sample Size Determination|We assumed that the incidence of the first or the only episode of pneumonia (first episode) in our placebo group would be 0·0585 per child per year based on the report that the incidence of acute lower respiratory infections in developing countries was greater than 0·65 per child per year,18 that 12% of these episodes were pneumonia, and 75% were first episodes.
PMC3348565|S91|Sample Size Determination|Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005,12 and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies1,2 we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group.
PMC3348565|S92|Sample Size Determination|Thus a study with 80% power and 95% significance needed 22 079 child-months per group (total of 2454 children for 18 months follow-up).
PMC3348565|S93|Sample Size Determination|Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up and allowing for protocol violations we intended to recruit 3050 children for 18 months follow-up.
PMC3348565|S96|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables).
PMC3348565|S97|Participant Loss and Exclusion|If a child was not seen for more than 45 days, at the two weekly visits, or at the hospital, they were censored for that period of our study.
PMC3348565|S100|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|For our intention-to-treat analysis we included all children randomly assigned to our study groups.
PMC3348565|S101|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|For our per-protocol analysis we included children who in both groups received all doses with an interval between the doses of 60 and 120 days and had not violated the randomisation codes.
PMC3348565|S103|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We made initial comparisons of time-to-an-episode between the two groups with log-rank tests and Kaplan–Meier plots.
PMC3348565|S104|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We estimated the incidence rate ratio (RR) for the episodes of pneumonia with Cox proportional hazard models.
PMC3348565|S105|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We assessed violation of the proportionality assumption with Schoenfeld residuals.

PMC3348565|S117|Participant Flow|Figure 1 shows the trial profile.
PMC3348565|S118|Participant Flow,Participant Loss and Exclusion|By the end of our trial 2616 of the 3046 recruited children were present in our study and 17 had died.
PMC3348565|S119|Ancillary Analyses|The mortality rate in our study cohort was 4·2 per 1000 child years (95% CI 2·4–6·7): 4·2 per 1000 child years (2·4–6·7; ten cases) in our vitamin D group and 3·4 per 1000 child years (1·3–7·1; seven cases) in our placebo group.
PMC3348565|S120|Ancillary Analyses|The difference was not statistically significant, although our study was not powered to detect differences in death rate.
PMC3348565|S121|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Six children in the vitamin D and four in the placebo group died of septicaemia or pneumonia.
PMC3348565|S122|Participant Loss and Exclusion|The remaining seven deaths were due to accidental or congenital causes.
PMC3348565|S123|Harms|We did not record any immediate or other adverse events associated with vitamin D3 supplementation.
PMC3348565|S124|Baseline Data|Table 1 Baseline characteristics of trial children and their families
PMC3348565|S125|Participant Loss and Exclusion|The number of children lost to follow-up was low and many children lost at one time because of travel rejoined the study later with rates being similar between the two groups (figure 1).

PMC3348565|S130|Outcome Results|Table 3 Person-time at risk and incidence rate of repeat episodes of pneumonia from all sources (intention-to-treat analysis)
PMC3348565|S131|Outcome Results|On intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of the first episode of pneumonia was greater in the vitamin D rather than the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (table 2).
PMC3348565|S132|Outcome Results|The incidence rate of repeat episodes of all type pneumonia was significantly higher in the vitamin D group (table 3).
PMC3348565|S133|Outcome Results|Restricting the definition of pneumonia confirmed with chest radiography to consolidation only, gave a rate of 0·011 per child per year (95% CI 0·008–0·017) in the vitamin D group and 0·008 (0·005–0·013) in the placebo group; this difference was not significant RR 1·44 (0·76–2·72).
PMC3348565|S134|Outcome Results|Extending the time between two consecutive episodes of pneumonia to 30 days to define a new repeat episode of pneumonia (used by the WHO Vaccine Trials group),19 gave similar results (data not shown).
PMC3348565|S136|Outcome Results|The proportion of children without an episode of pneumonia during our 18 month study did not differ between the groups (figure 2).
PMC3348565|S137|Outcome Results|The incidence of first episodes of simple, severe or very severe pneumonias confirmed with chest radiography also did not differ (table 1, appendix).
PMC3348565|S138|Ancillary Analyses|There were very few protocol violations and the results of our per-protocol and post-hoc analyses for children getting four and five consecutive doses were not different from that of our intention-to-treat analysis (table 2, 3; appendix) A further post-hoc analysis of the pneumonia rates by season also did not reveal any difference between the groups in our intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses (data not shown).
PMC3348565|S139|Outcome Results|Figure 3 Boxplot of serum calcifediol concentration
PMC3348565|S144|Harms|One child in the vitamin D group in January, 2008, and one in May, 2008, had serum concentrations greater than 375 nmol/L (not shown).
PMC3348565|S145|Outcome Results|The mean serum calcifediol concentration was consistently and significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months after administration of the first dose of vitamin D during the winter and at 2 weeks' post administration of dose 3 (spring; figure 3).
PMC3348565|S146|Harms|One child in the first sample (1 week after the first dose in November, 2008) and one in the spring sample (a month after the second dose) of the intervention group had results greater than 375 nmol/L—a toxic level.6
PMC3348565|S148|Interpretation|Our trial in a population known to be vitamin D deficient shows that 100 000 IU (2·5 mg) of vitamin D3 supplementation once every 3 months did not affect the incidence or severity of childhood pneumonia, in this population.
PMC3348565|S149|Interpretation|Similarly, vitamin D3 supplementation did not affect hospital admissions and all-cause mortality.
PMC3348565|S154|Interpretation|Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation.
PMC3348565|S155|Interpretation|Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups.
PMC3348565|S156|Limitations,Generalizability|However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown.
PMC3348565|S157|Interpretation|There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study.
PMC3348565|S158|Limitations|Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.20
PMC3348565|S160|Interpretation|As with other studies, dietary calcium deficiency might have led to so-called wastage of body stores of vitamin D in both groups, affecting the maintenance of even higher vitamin D levels in the intervention group.
PMC3348565|S161|Interpretation|Nevertheless, there was a higher (adequate level) mean serum concentration of calcifediol at the end of first supplementation period in the intervention group compared with the lower (not adequate) mean concentrations in the placebo group (data not shown).
PMC3348565|S162|Interpretation|Furthermore, adult fracture-outcome supplementation studies21 show no benefit from adding calcium.
PMC3348565|S163|Limitations|A further limitation of our study is that it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation.
PMC3348565|S164|Interpretation|Our sample testing suggest that the vitamin D group maintained above mean adequate vitamin D concetrations verses consistently low concentrations in the placebo group.
PMC3348565|S165|Interpretation|It can be argued that a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children because of fluctuations in serum concentrations due to our study regimen.
PMC3348565|S181|Interpretation|Our findings show that bolus quarterly supplementation of 100 000 IU vitamin D3 did not reduce the rate or severity of radiologically confirmed or clinically defined pneumonia.
PMC3348565|S182|Interpretation|This finding is surprising in view of evidence suggesting an association between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory infections.
PMC3348565|S183|Interpretation|However, our findings are similar to some previous studies on the effect of supplementation on infections of the upper respiratory tract or other outcomes such as bone fractures, cancers, and heart disease, and they contribute to the debate on factors that determine the immunological effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation.
PMC3348565|S184|Interpretation|Our findings are at odds with smaller case-control hospital studies that show an enhanced rate of vitamin D deficiency or rickets in children with pneumonia and the increasing evidence suggesting that calcitriol, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, has an important role in the human immune system.4
PMC3348565|S192|Interpretation|As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined.
PMC3348565|S196|Interpretation|Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true.
PMC3348565|S197|Interpretation|If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with13,14 and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged <6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations.
PMC3348565|S198|Interpretation|Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below −3).
PMC3348565|S199|Interpretation|Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100 000 IU vitamin D3 given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months.3
PMC3348565|S200|Interpretation|The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor,5 which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals.
PMC3348565|S201|Interpretation|In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given.
PMC3348565|S202|Interpretation|Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis.20
PMC3348565|S203|Interpretation|Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings.
PMC3348565|S205|Limitations|However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects.
PMC3348565|S206|Interpretation|Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100 000 IU of vitamin D3 has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0–9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D.16
PMC3348565|S209|Harms|It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/L—thought undesirably high.6
PMC3348565|S210|Interpretation|Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation.
PMC3348565|S211|Interpretation|The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.
PMC3348565|S213|Generalizability|In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children.

PMC3391717|S2|Title (Randomized)|Magnesium for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (MASH-2): a randomised placebo-controlled trial
PMC3391717|S5|Structured Abstract|Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia.
PMC3391717|S24|Funding|Netherlands Heart Foundation, UK Medical Research Council.
PMC3391717|S33|Background|In our randomised phase 2 trial, which included 283 patients in The Netherlands, delayed cerebral ischaemia occurred in 22 of 139 (16%) patients who received intravenous magnesium 64 mmol/day plus usual care with oral nimodipine compared with 35 of 144 (24%) patients who received placebo plus nimodipine.
PMC3391717|S35|Background|A Cochrane review5 of treatment with calcium antagonists after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage included three trials (379 patients) of magnesium in addition to nimodipine, and confirmed that intravenous magnesium plus nimodipine is superior to placebo for the prevention of delayed cerebral ischaemia (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·45–0·96) and poor outcome (0·75, 0·57–1·00).
PMC3391717|S36|Objective|In this study, we test the effect of intravenous magnesium sulphate on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717|S39|Trial Design,Data Collection Setting|We did this phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled trial at six Dutch, one Scottish, and one Chilean centre.
PMC3391717|S40|Protocol Access|The trial protocol has been published.11
PMC3391717|S41|Eligibility Criteria|Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted to the neurological or neurosurgical units of one of the participating hospitals within 4 days of haemorrhage.
PMC3391717|S43|Eligibility Criteria|For patients with a normal CT scan and xanthochromia of cerebrospinal fluid, proof of an aneurysm was a prerequisite for inclusion.
PMC3391717|S44|Eligibility Criteria|We included patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage on CT only if they had an aneurysm of the posterior circulation.
PMC3391717|S45|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, renal failure (defined as serum creatinine concentration of more than 150 μmol/L), bodyweight less than 50 kg, or imminent death.
PMC3391717|S50|Randomization Implementation|The randomisation code was produced by the University Medical Center Utrecht (The Netherlands) pharmacy.
PMC3391717|S51|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Randomization Type|The pharmacy used computer-generated randomisation codes in blocks of four, and stratified by centre.
PMC3391717|S52|Allocation Concealment Mechanism|The pharmacy produced identical, sequentially numbered, randomly assigned boxes of study medication, containing either magnesium sulphate or placebo.
PMC3391717|S53|Randomization Implementation|Local investigators assigned the participant to the box with the lowest study number.
PMC3391717|S54|Randomization Implementation|The randomisation key was kept by the pharmacy of the University Medical Center Utrecht.
PMC3391717|S55|Blinding Procedure|Patients, treating physicians, and investigators assessing outcomes and analysing data were masked to the allocation.
PMC3391717|S59|Interventions|Study medication consisted of vials containing 64 mmol magnesium sulphate or placebo (saline), produced by the pharmacy of the University Medical Center Utrecht and distributed to the participating centres (except for the centre in Chile, which produced its own study medication).
PMC3391717|S62|Interventions|Therefore, participants received a fixed daily dose of 64 mmol magnesium sulphate reconstituted in 0·9% saline, or placebo, as soon as possible after providing consent.
PMC3391717|S63|Interventions|Investigators administered study medication continuously via intravenous infusion and continued for 20 days after haemorrhage onset, or until hospital discharge or death if it occurred sooner.
PMC3391717|S64|Interventions|Investigators checked renal function at least once every 2 days to prevent symptomatic hypermagnesaemia.
PMC3391717|S66|Interventions|We discouraged, but permitted, investigators to treat hypomagnesaemia at admission with intravenous magnesium sulphate.
PMC3391717|S67|Interventions|Investigators treated patients according to local protocols, which included oral nimodipine 360 mg/day, bed rest until aneurysm occlusion, and early aneurysm occlusion, and aimed at achievement of normovolaemia.
PMC3391717|S68|Outcomes|The primary outcome was dependence15 (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or 5) or death, 3 months after haemorrhage.
PMC3391717|S69|Outcomes|The research nurse and study coordinator collected outcome data centrally, and assessed the Rankin score by semi-structured telephone interview in the patient's own language.
PMC3391717|S70|Outcomes|The interview was translated into Dutch and Spanish with the standard procedure16,17 for forward–backward translation.
PMC3391717|S71|Outcomes|Secondary outcome measures were no symptoms (modified Rankin Scale score of 0) 3 months after haemorrhage and the difference between the distribution of all scores on the modified Rankin Scale.
PMC3391717|S74|Sample Size Determination|On the basis of these data we estimated that 1082 patients would be needed to confirm this effect with an α of 5% and 80% power.
PMC3391717|S75|Sample Size Determination|To allow for reliable detection of a slightly smaller effect (risk ratio 0·78) we decided to enrol 1200 patients.
PMC3391717|S79|Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|The data monitoring committee did two interim analyses during the study, after 350 and 750 patients had completed 3-month follow-up, with reference to a pre-defined stopping rule, and recommended continuation of the trial on both occasions.
PMC3391717|S80|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We analysed the results according to intention to treat by comparing poor outcome at 3 months in each group with a risk ratio and 95% CI.
PMC3391717|S82|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Planned subgroup analyses were done according to age, sex, clinical condition at admission, method of treatment of aneurysm, and whether the centre treated hypomagnesaemia with intravenous magnesium supplementation.
PMC3391717|S83|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We compared the distributions of the modified Rankin Scale scores with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
PMC3391717|S86|Registry/Number|This study is registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 68742385) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2006-003523-36).

PMC3391717|S92|Baseline Data|Table Baseline characteristics
PMC3391717|S93|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|We enrolled 1204 participants between April, 2004, and September, 2011.
PMC3391717|S94|Data Collection Setting|Of these, 1124 were enrolled in The Netherlands, 59 in Scotland, and 21 in Chile.
PMC3391717|S95|Participant Flow,Participant Loss and Exclusion,Numbers Analyzed|The randomisation code of one patient was missing because the medication packaging containing the study number was lost, leaving 606 participants allocated to the magnesium group and 597 to the placebo group (figure 1).
PMC3391717|S96|Baseline Data|Age, sex, clinical condition at admission, or method of aneurysm treatment did not differ substantially between the two groups at baseline (table).
PMC3391717|S97|Participant Loss and Exclusion|Outcome data were unavailable for one patient in the placebo group and two in the magnesium group (99·8% of patients completed follow-up).
PMC3391717|S98|Participant Loss and Exclusion|One was homeless with no available address or phone number, the second had been included while on holiday in The Netherlands, and the third could not be reached.
PMC3391717|S99|Outcome Results|Figure 2 Distributions of mRS score in the magnesium and placebo groups
PMC3391717|S103|Binary Outcome Results|Magnesium had no effect on the primary outcome; 158 (26·2%) of 604 patients in the magnesium group and 151 (25·3%) of 596 in the placebo group had a poor outcome (RR 1·03, 95% CI 0·85–1·25).
PMC3391717|S104|Outcome Results|The proportion of patients with no symptoms did not differ between the magnesium (46 of 604 patients; 7·6%) and placebo (46 of 596; 7·7%) groups (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·67–1·46).
PMC3391717|S105|Outcome Results|Furthermore, the distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores between the magnesium and the placebo groups was not significantly different (p=0·95; figure 2).
PMC3391717|S106|Ancillary Analyses|Figure 3 Subgroup analyses for primary outcome
PMC3391717|S111|Ancillary Analyses|Subgroup analyses for poor outcome showed much the same estimates of effect for women and men, old and young patients, good or poor clinical condition at admission, different methods of aneurysm treatment, and between centres that give magnesium for hypomagnesaemia (figure 3).
PMC3391717|S113|Harms|Study treatment was stopped for one patient because of asymptomatic hypocalcaemia, for two patients because of asymptomatic hypermagnesaemia, and for one patient because of suspected symptomatic hypermagnesaemia, all of which occurred in the magnesium group.
PMC3391717|S114|Harms|The latter patient also had renal insufficiency but study treatment was not stopped for this reason.
PMC3391717|S132|Interpretation|Randomised trials have suggested that magnesium is beneficial, but this finding was not reproduced in MASH 2.5
PMC3391717|S133|Interpretation|Previous studies were much smaller than MASH 2, and were not adequately powered, so the results might have been due to chance and might have been subject to publication bias.
PMC3391717|S134|Interpretation|A randomised controlled trial of magnesium for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage—published when our study was still ongoing—was also neutral, but did not have enough power to definitely rule out an effect.20
PMC3391717|S135|Interpretation|The MASH 2 trial is the first adequately powered randomised controlled trial that shows no beneficial effect of magnesium on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is confirmed by our meta-analysis (figure 4).18–20
PMC3391717|S136|Interpretation|Results from MASH 2 alone, and in combination with the other trial data (panel), show that intravenous magnesium does not affect outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717|S139|Interpretation|First, the putative pathophysiological mechanisms leading to delayed cerebral ischaemia and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which are targeted by magnesium treatment,6,9 might not be as important as other mechanisms that are not known to be affected by magnesium (eg, immediate ischaemia at the time of haemorrhage22).
PMC3391717|S140|Interpretation|Second, magnesium is not known to affect other complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage that affect outcome, including hydrocephalus, rebleeding, electrolyte disturbances, hyperglycaemia, and cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction.23
PMC3391717|S141|Interpretation|Third, intravenously administered magnesium does not seem to cross the blood–brain barrier well.
PMC3391717|S149|Generalizability|The treatment that the participants received is probably representative of care for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in middle-income to high-income countries.
PMC3391717|S150|Generalizability|A substantial number of patients with poor clinical condition at admission were included, which also adds to the generalisibility of our results.
PMC3391717|S152|Limitations|A limitation of our study is that we collected key baseline and outcome data, but did not call patients back for study visits for detailed assessment of quality of life.
PMC3391717|S153|Limitations|Because our study was pragmatically designed to assess whether magnesium improved clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, we chose poor outcome as our primary outcome measure.
PMC3391717|S154|Limitations|Delayed cerebral haemorrhage is only a surrogate or explanatory outcome measure, and so we did not include delayed cerebral haemorrhage as a secondary outcome.
PMC3391717|S155|Limitations|For the same reason, we did not include other baseline measurements such as amount of blood in CT scan or systemic illness, nor did we do close on-site monitoring.
PMC3391717|S156|Limitations|Furthermore, we do not have complete information about adherence to study medication.
PMC3391717|S157|Limitations|We did not require magnesium concentration to be routinely checked, in view of the results of our dose-finding and safety studies.13,14
PMC3391717|S158|Limitations|We cannot exclude the possibility of unmasking of investigators by checking patients' serum magnesium concentrations, although such unmasking will not have affected the primary or secondary outcome data, which were collected centrally by masked personnel.
PMC3391717|S159|Limitations|An effect of magnesium treatment on cognitive symptoms—which are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage28—might have been missed by the modified Rankin Scale.
PMC3391717|S160|Limitations|We measured clinical outcome 3 months after haemorrhage, which is a usual period for outcome assessment in stroke studies, and although a benefit might be detected later, we consider it unlikely in view of the probable mechanism of action of magnesium in the acute period after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717|S164|Limitations|In the same way, time to treatment with magnesium in MASH 2 might not have been short enough to ameliorate acute ischaemic injury and prevent delayed cerebral ischaemia because the initiation of the cascade leading to secondary injury might be irreversible.
PMC3391717|S167|Interpretation|On the basis of the results of MASH 2—a trial of treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with sufficient power to detect a clinically significant improvement in outcome—and in combination with data from other trials, we do not recommend routine use of intravenous magnesium 64 mmol/day for the improvement of outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

PMC3016167|S25|Registry/Number|Trial registration number CTRI/2010/091/000584 (Clinical Trials Registry India).
PMC3016167|S35|Background|Scorpion antivenom is a specific antidote capable of neutralising circulating venom toxins if administered soon after sting; it is widely used and believed to be effective by experienced doctors in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Tunisia, and Iran.13 14 15 16 17
PMC3016167|S42|Background|Prazosin is widely used for the management of Mesobuthus tamulus sting.11 12 25 26 27 28 29 30
PMC3016167|S43|Objective,Trial Design|We did a prospective, randomised trial of scorpion antivenom plus prazosin versus prazosin alone in the treatment of severe Mesobuthus tamulus sting.
PMC3016167|S46|Funding|This study and trial were done without the help of any funding agency.
PMC3016167|S48|Eligibility Criteria,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|We proposed to include people admitted with scorpion sting over one year, between March 2009 and February 2010.
PMC3016167|S49|Trial Design,Data Collection Setting|This was a randomised (1:1 allocation ratio), parallel group, open label, controlled trial conducted at Bawaskar Hospital in Mahad, a region of India with a population of 20 000, situated 180 km south of Mumbai on the Mumbai-Goa highway.
PMC3016167|S50|Protocol Access|An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored the trial and had access to the all data.
PMC3016167|S54|Outcomes|The primary efficacy variable was the time required for recovery after venomous scorpion sting.
PMC3016167|S55|Sample Size Determination|We estimated that 35 patients in each group would be required to achieve 80% power; α=0.05 to detect a mean difference of four hours in the recovery time between the groups, assuming a mean recovery time of 10 hours (SD 2.5 hours) in the antivenom plus prazosin group and 14 (SD 3) hours for the prazosin alone group.
PMC3016167|S57|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Randomization Type|A statistician generated the sequentially numbered randomisation list with random block sizes of 4 4 2 4 4 6 2 4 6 6 6 8 4 8 2 using www.randomisation.com.
PMC3016167|S58|Random Allocation Sequence Generation|This process can be reproduced by using seed 22491 (6 March 2009).
PMC3016167|S59|Allocation Concealment Mechanism|This randomisation sequence was concealed by using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed, and stapled envelopes.
PMC3016167|S60|Randomization Implementation|Envelopes were opened alternately by HSB or PHB after an eligible patient consented to take part in the trial and patients were allocated according to the randomisation label inside the envelope.
PMC3016167|S62|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Demographic factors and clinical characteristics were summarised as counts (percentages) for categorical variables and as mean (standard deviation; SD) for normally distributed continuous variables.
PMC3016167|S64|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|The groups were compared using χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, unpaired t test for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for other continuous variables.
PMC3016167|S65|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We analysed results with SPSS 17 software.
PMC3016167|S66|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured at different time points and were repeated factors, and treatment group was included as a between-participant measure.
PMC3016167|S67|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|α was set at 0.05.
PMC3016167|S68|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison,Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We used the Greenhouse-Geisser P value.
PMC3016167|S70|Eligibility Criteria,Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Between March 2009 and February 2010 we recruited patients who reported to Bawaskar Hospital and Mahad research centre after being stung by Mesobuthus tamulus (fig 1).2 4 6 31
PMC3016167|S73|Eligibility Criteria|Patients were eligible for enrolment if they reported to hospital with Mesobuthus tamulus sting of clinical grade 2 severity, with an interval of less than six hours between sting and hospital admission, and were older than six months.
PMC3016167|S74|Eligibility Criteria|Mesobuthus tamulus sting was confirmed if the victim or bystander had seen a red scorpion, had brought in the killed specimen, or recognised the hospital’s preserved specimen.
PMC3016167|S76|Eligibility Criteria|Major exclusion criteria were: patient reporting six hours after sting, pregnant women, history of taking prazosin or antivenom, history of bronchial asthma, history of allergic reaction to foreign serum, and refusal to give consent.
PMC3016167|S90|Eligibility Criteria|Patients with grade 2 signs and symptoms were included in the present study.
PMC3016167|S104|Interventions|A single 30 mL dose of Haffkine Biopharma monovalent antivenom (batch no SS811001, manufacturing date November 2008, expiry date April 2013) was added to 100 mL of normal saline, which was infused intravenously over 30 minutes irrespective of patient’s age.
PMC3016167|S105|Interventions|During infusion the patient was closely observed for reaction to the serum in the form of sudden onset of vomiting, urticaria, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm, angioneurotic oedema, or anaphylaxis.
PMC3016167|S106|Interventions|Oral prazosin (batch no ML.NH 138 batch no GK 60372 manufactured 04/2006, expiry 03/2011, and ML.NH 138 batch no GK 80282 manufactured 02/2008, expiry 01/2013) was given at a dose of 250 µg in children up age 18 years and 500 µg in adults.
PMC3016167|S107|Interventions|The same dose was repeated at intervals of 3 hours until the extremities were cold.
PMC3016167|S108|Interventions|Similar doses were administered in both randomisation groups.
PMC3016167|S109|Interventions|Dehydration owing to vomiting and sweating was corrected by intravenous crystalloid solution.
PMC3016167|S110|Interventions|The prazosin treated group required longer duration and larger volumes of intravenous crystalloid solution than the antivenom plus prazosin group.
PMC3016167|S111|Interventions|Patients who developed grade 3 and 4 symptoms were transferred to the intensive care unit.
PMC3016167|S112|Interventions|Before discharge all participants were immunised for tetanus.
PMC3016167|S114|Outcomes|The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving resolution of the grade 2 clinical syndrome at the end of 10 hours after administration of the study drugs and prevention of deterioration to grade 3 and 4.18 21 37
PMC3016167|S115|Outcomes|Secondary end points were time required for complete resolution of clinical syndrome, prevention of deterioration to higher grade, doses of prazosin required within 10 hours and overall, and adverse events.
PMC3016167|S117|Participant Flow|Figure 2 shows the trial profile.
PMC3016167|S118|Participant Flow|We screened 116 patients admitted with scorpion sting for eligibility.
PMC3016167|S119|Participant Flow|Of 72 eligible patients, 70 were enrolled in the study; 35 were randomly allocated to prazosin alone and 35 to prazosin plus antivenom.
PMC3016167|S120|Participant Loss and Exclusion|All patients completed treatment in the group of allocation and none was lost to follow-up.
PMC3016167|S122|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Patients were recruited between March 2009 and February 2010 (table 1).
PMC3016167|S124|Participant Flow|Fig 2 Trial profile
PMC3016167|S126|Baseline Data|The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline (table 2).
PMC3016167|S127|Baseline Data|Mean time between scorpion sting and arrival at hospital and presenting symptoms were also similar between the groups.
PMC3016167|S128|Baseline Data|Table 2  Demographic and baseline clinical data
PMC3016167|S129|Outcome Results|Table 3 shows recovery time for clinical signs and symptoms in the two groups.
PMC3016167|S133|Outcome Results|Table 3  Recovery time for clinical syndrome
PMC3016167|S134|Binary Outcome Results|Thirty-two patients (91.4%, 95% confidence interval 76.9% to 97.8%) on prazosin plus antivenom showed complete resolution of the clinical syndrome within 10 hours of administration of treatment, compared with eight patients (22.9%, 11.8% to 39.3%) in the prazosin group; P<0.001 (table 4).
PMC3016167|S135|Outcome Results|The mean time required for clearing of syndrome and recovery in the antivenom plus prazosin group was 8.0 hours (95% confidence interval 6.5 to 9.5), which was significantly shorter (mean difference −9.7 hours, −6.9 to −12.4) than for those treated only with prazosin (17.7 hours, 15.4 to 19.9; P<0.001).
PMC3016167|S136|Outcome Results|The median recovery time for patients treated with antivenom plus prazosin (7 hours) was significantly less than that for patients treated with only prazosin (18 hours; P<.0.001).
PMC3016167|S137|Outcome Results,Binary Outcome Results|Table 4  Comparison of endpoints between the groups
PMC3016167|S138|Outcome Results|Patients in the antivenom plus prazosin group required significantly (P<0.001) fewer doses of prazosin (mean 2.3, 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.5) than the prazosin group (mean doses 4.4, 95% CI 4.0 to 4; mean difference −2.0, 95% CI −2.5 to 1.6).
PMC3016167|S139|Outcome Results,Harms|Fewer patients in the antivenom plus prazosin group (12/35, 34.3%) developed hypotension than those in the prazosin only group (19/35, 54.3%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.092, tables 3 and 4).
PMC3016167|S147|Outcome Results|Nine participants (six children and three adults) deteriorated to grade 3 (five from the prazosin group and three from prazosin plus antivenom group) or grade 4 (one from the prazosin plus antivenom group).
PMC3016167|S161|Harms|She developed marked tachycardia (heart rate 170 beats per minute) and warm extremities with blood pressure 95/70 mm Hg and pulmonary oedema (grade 4).
PMC3016167|S162|Interventions|She was given nasal oxygen, dobutamine 15 µg /kg/minute was raised to 20 µg, and oxygen saturation was maintained by non-invasive ventilator for 24 hours in intensive care.
PMC3016167|S164|Outcome Results|We found that in patients treated for scorpion sting with scorpion antivenom and prazosin incidences of improvement and deterioration were similar to those in patients treated with prazosin alone, and the addition of antivenom hastened recovery.
PMC3016167|S194|Interpretation|Our findings in relation to a substantial number of patients with grade 2 envenomation included in this study support a firm conclusion about the efficacy of antivenom plus prazosin in victims reporting within six hours of sting with systemic involvement.
PMC3016167|S195|Eligibility Criteria,Limitations|Cases of grade 3 and grade 4 envenomation were not included in the present study, as required by the ethics committee.
PMC3016167|S197|Blinding Procedure,Limitations|This study was not blinded and the primary outcome was evaluated by study investigators, albeit investigators with extensive clinical experience with scorpion sting.1 9 11 20 25 33 34
PMC3016167|S198|Limitations|The determination of the point at which symptoms disappeared was thus subjective, but we think that this was a clinically relevant and pragmatic way of judging the effects of treatment in a trial carried out in challenging circumstances with restricted resources in a rural setting in India.
PMC3016167|S201|Interpretation|The sympathetic signs suggest after effects of venom on the sympathetic system, which are unresponsive to antivenom but reversible with prazosin.
PMC3016167|S203|Interpretation|Thus, early administration of antivenom in a stage of acetylcholine excess and prazosin to counteract the sympathetic and metabolic effects may be synergistic in enhancing recovery.1 2 3 4 10 12 15 17
PMC3016167|S205|Interpretation|Total doses of prazosin required were significantly lower in the antivenom plus prazosin group than in the prazosin alone group, suggesting that timely administration of scorpion antivenom leads to rapid neutralisation of circulating venom, resulting in minimum venom available for neuronal sodium channel activation.
PMC3016167|S206|Interpretation|Amelioration of parasympathetic stimulation (sweating, salivation, arrhythmias) by antivenom may have accounted for the lower incidence of hypotension in the antivenom plus prazosin group.
PMC3016167|S207|Interpretation|Leucocytosis and raised cardiac enzymes were suggestive of the release of cytokines such as interleukin-6.22 38
PMC3016167|S208|Outcome Results|No participant had a mild or severe reaction to antivenom.
PMC3016167|S210|Interpretation|Administration of the minimum first dose of prazosin prevented the development of the first dose phenomenon.43
PMC3016167|S211|Limitations|Owing to unavailability of an ELISA test for detection of venom antigen and antivenom in blood we could not perform a correlation with clinical manifestations.
PMC3016167|S212|Limitations|Facilities for analysis of serum catecholamine levels are not available at Mahad.
PMC3016167|S213|Limitations|We could not enrol patients with grade 3 and 4 severe scorpion stings owing to restriction by the ethics committee.
PMC3016167|S214|Limitations|Withholding the lifesaving drug prazosin would be unethical in a life threatening situation; hence it was included in both the arms of the trial and no placebo group was included.
PMC3016167|S216|Outcome Results|Early administration of antivenom within six hours of sting in addition to prazosin hastened the recovery and shortened the hospital stay in a rural setting.
PMC3016167|S219|Outcome Results|Administration of prazosin at an interval of three hours prevented development of pulmonary oedema and led to rapid recovery as reported previously.33
PMC3016167|S220|Generalizability|The results of the present study would be applicable in settings such as primary health centres, where the majority of the victims first present.1

PMC3076731|S2|Title (Randomized)|Effect of oxandrolone and timing of pubertal induction on final height in Turner’s syndrome: randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial
PMC3076731|S4|Structured Abstract,Objective|Objective To examine the effect of oxandrolone and the timing of pubertal induction on final height in girls with Turner’s syndrome receiving a standard dose of growth hormone.
PMC3076731|S18|Registry/Number|Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN50343149.
PMC3076731|S29|Background|Most girls with Turner’s syndrome need oestrogen therapy during adolescence to induce pubertal development.16
PMC3076731|S30|Background|However, the optimal age at which to begin remains controversial; some people advocate a delay to extend the growth period and increase final height,5 6 17 18 whereas others have highlighted psychological problems of delaying pubertal development, suggesting that the benefits are marginal.19
PMC3076731|S34|Data Collection Setting|Members of the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes recruited patients from participating paediatric endocrinology departments in UK hospitals.
PMC3076731|S35|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion criteria for participation of patients were karyotype confirmed Turner’s syndrome (all karyotypes were eligible, including mosaic), age 7-13 years, no previous growth hormone treatment or previous treatment in the range 8.3-11.7 mg/m2/week in five to seven injections a week, no previous oxandrolone and oestrogen therapy, and open epiphyses.
PMC3076731|S36|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria were major systemic illness that might affect growth and social or psychological difficulties likely to seriously impair concordance.
PMC3076731|S38|Trial Design|We devised a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised controlled trial, including two randomisations in a two by two factorial design.
PMC3076731|S47|Randomization Type|The British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinical Trials Unit (Cambridge, UK) used minimisation by weighted randomisation for the study’s two randomisations.20
PMC3076731|S48|Randomization Implementation,Interventions|Randomisation 1, to oxandrolone or placebo, took place at age 9 years (or at enrolment, if older) and was balanced for enrolling centre, quarter of mid-parental height, and previous exposure to growth hormone treatment.
PMC3076731|S49|Randomization Implementation,Interventions|Randomisation 2 took place at age 12 years in girls with ovarian failure (basal serum follicle stimulating hormone concentration >10 U/L), with additional minimisation for randomisation 1, to begin oral ethinylestradiol or placebo at 12 years; the placebo group subsequently started ethinylestradiol at 14 years.
PMC3076731|S50|Randomization Implementation|Girls with a follicle stimulating hormone concentration below 10U/L and a karyotype associated with preservation of ovarian function (45,X/46,XX and 45,X/47,XXX21) (the spontaneous puberty group) were not randomised at randomisation 2.
PMC3076731|S51|Randomization Implementation|Girls with other karyotypes were tested for concentrations of gonadotrophin releasing hormone and were randomised at randomisation 2 if the peak follicle stimulating hormone concentration was above 30 U/L.
PMC3076731|S52|Interventions|Participants enrolled after the age of 12.25 years and without spontaneous puberty (the late group) started ethinylestradiol at 14 years.
PMC3076731|S54|Interventions|All participants received the growth hormone preparation of their choice at 10 mg/m2/week in daily subcutaneous injections.
PMC3076731|S55|Interventions|Oral oxandrolone (SPA, Milan, Italy) was given at 0.05 mg/kg/day, with a maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg.
PMC3076731|S56|Interventions|Oral ethinylestradiol (UCB Pharma, Slough, UK) was given daily as follows, regardless of the age at starting: year 1, 2 μg; year 2, 4 μg; year 3, four months each of 6, 8, and 10 μg.
PMC3076731|S57|Interventions,Randomization Implementation|The code for randomisation 2 was broken at 15 years to allow introduction of progesterone therapy: oral norethisterone (CP Pharmaceuticals, Wrexham, UK) 5 mg daily for five days each month.
PMC3076731|S58|Interventions|Treatment with growth hormone and oxandrolone continued until final height was reached.
PMC3076731|S59|Interventions|Oestrogen/progesterone therapy continued at an adult replacement dose once pubertal induction was completed.
PMC3076731|S60|Similarity of Interventions|White, uncoated, flat bevelled edge placebo tablets (7 and 5 mm in diameter) (Essential Nutrition, Brough, UK) were specially manufactured to match the size, weight, and appearance of oxandrolone 2.5 mg and ethinylestradiol 2 µg tablets respectively.
PMC3076731|S61|Blinding Procedure|The study’s central pharmacy (Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK) supplied all tablets in a double blind, placebo controlled fashion; only staff at the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinical Trials Unit and the central distributing pharmacy were not blinded to treatment allocations.
PMC3076731|S63|Changes TO Trial Design|In 2004 and 2008, the sole European manufacturer of oxandrolone 2.5 mg ceased production, resulting in 34 participants in 2004 and 11 in 2008 temporarily suspending active oxandrolone treatment (mean duration: 2004, 52 days; 2008, 163 days).
PMC3076731|S64|Changes TO Trial Design|In 2008, the decision was taken to terminate the treatment arm forthwith, resulting in eight participants stopping oxandrolone treatment prematurely.
PMC3076731|S66|Outcomes|At clinic visits every four to six months, height was measured with a Harpenden stadiometer to the last completed 1 mm and converted to an SD score by using the British 1990 reference.22
PMC3076731|S67|Outcomes|Radiographs of the left wrist were obtained annually, and a single observer (WFP) analysed them for bone age estimation according to the Tanner Whitehouse II method.23
PMC3076731|S72|Outcomes|The primary outcome was final height, defined as height velocity less than 1 cm/year and bone age at least 15.5 years.
PMC3076731|S73|Outcomes|Secondary outcomes were maximum height (that is, the most recently available height), age of attaining final height, and the three summary growth parameters from the SITAR analysis described below.
PMC3076731|S74|Sample Size Determination|Assuming a standard deviation of 5 cm, we needed 50 girls in each group to detect a difference between groups in mean final height of 2.8 cm with 80% power at 5% significance—a total of 100 patients.
PMC3076731|S76|Sample Size Determination|In the event, more than 100 patients were recruited, but fewer than 100 were followed up to final height.
PMC3076731|S77|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|We estimated the effects of the two randomisations separately by using multiple regression.
PMC3076731|S78|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|We also adjusted randomisation 2 (timing of pubertal induction) for randomisation 1 (oxandrolone) and tested for an interaction.
PMC3076731|S79|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|In addition, we applied SITAR (superimposition by translation and rotation), a novel method of growth curve analysis, to the data.24
PMC3076731|S80|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|SITAR transforms individual growth curves so that they become essentially the same as each other and, when superimposed, define the average summary curve.
PMC3076731|S81|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|To achieve this, each individual curve is suitably altered in three distinct ways: the curve is shifted up/down (a measure of the child’s size in cm) and left/right (a measure of growth tempo in years), and the age axis is stretched/squashed (a measure of percentage velocity).
PMC3076731|S86|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up,Participant Loss and Exclusion,Participant Flow|One hundred and six girls with Turner’s syndrome were recruited from 36 UK hospitals between 1999 and 2003, of whom 14 withdrew (four of them because of early organisational errors), leaving 92 to complete the study (fig 1).
PMC3076731|S87|Baseline Data|The breakdown of karyotypes was 45,X (39), 45,X/46,XX (18), 45,X/46,XrX (9), complex mosaics containing three or more cell lines (8), 45,X/46,XiX (7), 45,X/45,XY (7), 46,XX including a structural abnormality of second X (7), 45,X/46,XY including a structural abnormality of Y (3), 45,X/46,XX including a structural abnormality of second X (3), 45,X/47,XXX (2), and other (3).
PMC3076731|S88|Participant Flow|All 106 participants were randomised at or after 9 years of age to oxandrolone or placebo (randomisation 1), and 60 were also randomised at 12 years to early or late induction of puberty (randomisation 2).
PMC3076731|S89|Participant Flow|Of the 46 girls not randomised at 12 years, 21 enrolled after 12 years (the late group), 18 had spontaneous puberty, and seven had withdrawn before the age of 12 years.
PMC3076731|S91|Baseline Data,Outcome Results|Table 1 shows participants’ characteristics at enrolment, at maximum height, and at final height by treatment group.
PMC3076731|S92|Outcome Results|At the time of writing, 82 participants had attained a mean final height of 151.8 (SD 6.4) cm, and 10 others continued growing.
PMC3076731|S93|Outcome Results|Table 2 shows details of final height and maximum height according to the study’s two randomisations.

PMC3076731|S96|Outcome Results|Table 2  Final height and maximum height data for participants randomised twice, according to randomisation 1 (oxandrolone/placebo) and randomisation 2 (pubertal induction at 14/12 years).
PMC3076731|S98|Outcome Results|By twice randomised group, the mean final heights were placebo/early induction 147.0 cm, placebo/late induction 153.1 cm, oxandrolone/early induction 154.4 cm, and oxandrolone/late induction 155.1 cm (table 1).
PMC3076731|S99|Outcome Results|Table 3 summarises the results of the randomised comparisons.
PMC3076731|S100|Outcome Results|For randomisation 1, final height was significantly greater with oxandrolone than placebo (4.6 cm, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 7.2; P=0.001).
PMC3076731|S101|Outcome Results|Similarly, for randomisation 2, final height was significantly greater with pubertal induction at 14 years than at 12 years (3.8 cm, 0.0 to 7.5; P=0.05).
PMC3076731|S102|Outcome Results|Table 3  Effects of two randomisations, their interaction, and their combination, on mean final height and mean maximum height
PMC3076731|S104|Outcome Results|Among girls previously randomised to oxandrolone, the effect of late induction compared with early induction was clinically insignificant (+0.7 cm); in the placebo group, however, late induction added 6.2 cm compared with early induction (table 3, interaction).
PMC3076731|S106|Outcome Results|The mean effect on final height of oxandrolone, late induction of puberty, or both compared with placebo and early induction was +7.1 cm (that is, the mean final height in the combined oxandrolone/early, oxandrolone/late, and placebo/late groups compared with the placebo/early group), which is appreciably larger than the effects for either randomisation alone (table 3, combination).
PMC3076731|S108|Outcome Results|The standard deviation for the combined group was 5.1 cm, rather less than the 7.4 cm for the placebo/early induction group (P=0.1), suggesting that treatment preferentially benefited the shortest girls.
PMC3076731|S109|Outcome Results|Table 3 also includes the results for maximum height, based on the 92 girls still in the trial.
PMC3076731|S110|Outcome Results|The oxandrolone effect of +4.3 cm (P=0.002) was similar to that for final height (+4.6 cm), and the late induction effect of +2.4 cm (P=0.2) was appreciably smaller than the +3.8 cm for final height.
PMC3076731|S111|Outcome Results|The age of attainment of final height was similar for oxandrolone and placebo (16.2 v 16.7 years; P=0.1) and later, by design, for late versus early induction (16.9 v 16.1 years; P=0.009).
PMC3076731|S113|Participant Loss and Exclusion|We applied the SITAR analysis to the 105 participants with at least one height measurement (one girl in the control group withdrew immediately after randomisation 1).
PMC3076731|S114|Outcome Results|Figure 2 shows individual height curves unadjusted (top panel) and SITAR adjusted with the summary curve (bottom panel).
PMC3076731|S116|Outcome Results|Fig 2 Individual height growth curves according to randomisation 1: unadjusted (top) and SITAR adjusted (bottom)
PMC3076731|S117|Outcome Results|The SITAR adjustment process estimated the size, tempo, and velocity parameters for each participant, which when applied to their curves made them all very similar, with a residual standard deviation of 0.6 mm around the summary curve (fig 2, bottom panel).
PMC3076731|S118|Outcome Results|Comparison of the mean values of the parameters by trial arm showed differences in size (oxandrolone v placebo +2.6 cm; P=0.02) but not tempo (−0.3 years; P=0.1), and the mean velocity was dramatically greater for oxandrolone (difference +23%, SE 4%; P<0.001).
PMC3076731|S122|Outcome Results|Fig 3 SITAR fitted summary height curves by trial arm for randomisation 1 (top) and randomisation 2 (bottom)
PMC3076731|S124|Outcome Results|The differences here were smaller, the curves diverging only after 14 years; the late versus early comparisons for size (+2.2 cm) and velocity (−9%) were statistically insignificant (P>0.1), whereas tempo was slightly delayed in the late induction arm (+0.4 years; P=0.06).
PMC3076731|S127|Harms|Ten were classified as serious adverse events, as they involved admission to hospital for procedures including appendicectomy and ear, nose, and throat surgery (for example, grommet (ventilation tube) insertion).
PMC3076731|S128|Harms|Four adverse events could have been related to oxandrolone or ethinylestradiol: acne in a 15 year old (all study drugs were continued, and randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 14 years); persistent hypertension in a 13 year old (oxandrolone/placebo was stopped and antihypertensive treatment started, blood pressure normalised, and oxandrolone/placebo treatment was restarted; the randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 12 years); abnormal liver function in a 16 year old (the participant was at near final height and elected to stop growth promoting treatment; randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 14 years); and episodic “hot flushes” in a 15 year old (all study drugs were continued; randomisation was later revealed as placebo and pubertal induction at 14 years).
PMC3076731|S131|Interpretation|This randomised controlled trial of growth promoting treatment in Turner’s syndrome showed a clear benefit to final height of oxandrolone treatment and of introducing ethinylestradiol for pubertal induction at age 14 rather than 12 years.
PMC3076731|S133|Interpretation|This positive effect of oxandrolone on final height compares favourably with previous studies.5 6 11 12
PMC3076731|S141|Interpretation|Although oxandrolone could have contributed to the cases of acne, hypertension, and abnormal liver function, causality cannot be assumed as these are commonly seen in Turner’s syndrome.25 26
PMC3076731|S144|Interpretation|Furthermore, the maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg used in the UK study irrespective of body weight could account for the absence of reported virilisation.
PMC3076731|S145|Interpretation|The UK Turner Study has also shown a positive effect on final height of introducing ethinylestradiol at age 14 rather than 12 years, consistent with the effect of oestrogen on epiphyseal fusion and supporting previous published associations between delayed pubertal induction and increased height.6 13 18
PMC3076731|S147|Interpretation|The finding that oxandrolone allows timely pubertal induction is thus attractive and in keeping with other work.30 31 32 33 34
PMC3076731|S149|Interpretation|However, whereas both oxandrolone and late induction have been shown to increase final height, the two effects were not additive, so that giving either is beneficial but giving both is no better.
PMC3076731|S150|Interpretation|One possible explanation for this is that there is a “ceiling” for the extra height available from growth promoting strategies in Turner’s syndrome.
PMC3076731|S151|Interpretation|The subset of participants who were randomised twice and received oxandrolone had a larger “gain” in final height than did those who did not need any oestrogen treatment, whether they received oxandrolone or not.
PMC3076731|S152|Interpretation|The numbers were too small to allow more detailed analysis, but we speculate that the girls who showed spontaneous puberty would have fused their epiphyses earlier than the other girls, which may have resulted in a less favourable final height.
PMC3076731|S156|Limitations|The number of girls who had completed the study and achieved final height at the time of analysis (n=82) fell short of the target sample size of 100.
PMC3076731|S157|Limitations|Even when the remaining girls complete the study, the number evaluable at final height will still only be 92.
PMC3076731|S159|Limitations|However, the failure to achieve the target sample size may have limited the ability to detect an interaction between the two randomisations.
PMC3076731|S160|Limitations|Unfortunately, the break in production of oxandrolone 2.5 mg tablets twice led to deviations from the protocol.
PMC3076731|S161|Limitations|Placebo tablets were unavailable for other oxandrolone preparations, and eventually the difficulties in supply led to the early termination of the treatment arm.
PMC3076731|S162|Limitations|Therefore, the results may underestimate the true effect of oxandrolone.
PMC3076731|S166|Limitations|However, the group sizes of those who were randomised twice and attained final height were too small to allow further breakdown by karyotype.
PMC3076731|S167|Limitations|A measure of bone mineral density was not included in the study protocol and would have provided valuable information.
PMC3076731|S168|Limitations|Although its value is now recognised in this patient group, the necessary scanning equipment was not routinely available at all participating centres when the study started.
PMC3076731|S172|Interpretation|We recommend, therefore, that when growth promotion is being considered in girls with Turner’s syndrome, families are offered oxandrolone as an alternative to late pubertal induction.

PMC3103669|S2|Title (Randomized)|Canakinumab reduces the risk of acute gouty arthritis flares during initiation of allopurinol treatment: results of a double-blind, randomised study
PMC3103669|S5|Structured Abstract|This study assessed the efficacy and safety of canakinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin 1β monoclonal antibody, for prophylaxis against acute gouty arthritis flares in patients initiating urate-lowering treatment.
PMC3103669|S7|Trial Design|In this double-blind, double-dummy, dose-ranging study, 432 patients with gouty arthritis initiating allopurinol treatment were randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1:2 to receive: a single dose of canakinumab, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg subcutaneously; 4×4-weekly doses of canakinumab (50+50+25+25 mg subcutaneously); or daily colchicine 0.5 mg orally for 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S8|Outcomes|Patients recorded details of flares in diaries.
PMC3103669|S9|Trial Design|The study aimed to determine the canakinumab dose having equivalent efficacy to colchicine 0.5 mg at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S11|Interpretation|A dose-response for canakinumab was not apparent with any of the four predefined dose-response models.
PMC3103669|S12|Interpretation|The estimated canakinumab dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of doses tested.
PMC3103669|S13|Outcome Results|At 16 weeks, there was a 62% to 72% reduction in the mean number of flares per patient for canakinumab doses ≥50 mg versus colchicine based on a negative binomial model (rate ratio: 0.28–0.38, p≤0.0083), and the percentage of patients experiencing ≥1 flare was significantly lower for all canakinumab doses (15% to 27%) versus colchicine (44%, p<0.05).
PMC3103669|S14|Binary Outcome Results|There was a 64% to 72% reduction in the risk of experiencing ≥1 flare for canakinumab doses ≥50 mg versus colchicine at 16 weeks (hazard ratio (HR): 0.28–0.36, p≤0.05).
PMC3103669|S15|Harms|The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups.
PMC3103669|S17|Interpretation|Single canakinumab doses ≥50 mg or four 4-weekly doses provided superior prophylaxis against flares compared with daily colchicine 0.5 mg.
PMC3103669|S32|Background|Three recent trials used colchicine for prophylaxis in patients initiating ULT (with febuxostat), but provide limited data on the efficacy of colchicine.17 21 22
PMC3103669|S33|Objective|There is therefore a need for more rigorous assessment of the efficacy of colchicine as prophylaxis against flares following ULT initiation and the introduction of alternative therapies.
PMC3103669|S34|Background|Several lines of evidence suggest that the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), plays a key role in mediating the initiation of inflammation in gouty arthritis in a similar manner to that occurring in the hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS),23 24 and may also contribute to joint destruction in gouty arthritis.6 25 26
PMC3103669|S35|Objective|This suggests that selective blockade of IL-1β signalling may provide effective prophylaxis against flares in patients with gouty arthritis and is supported by results showing that IL-1β blockade with canakinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-1β with a half-life of 3–4 weeks,27 can effectively reduce pain, inflammation and the risk of recurrent flares in patients with acute gouty arthritis.28
PMC3103669|S36|Objective|Here, we report the results of a dose-ranging, active-controlled phase II trial to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of canakinumab as prophylaxis against flares in patients initiating allopurinol treatment.
PMC3103669|S39|Trial Design|This was a 24-week, dose-ranging, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study and was approved by all responsible independent ethics committees.
PMC3103669|S41|Registry/Number|The trial was registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT00819585).
PMC3103669|S42|Outcomes|At screening, patients indicated which of their joints was most affected by previous gouty arthritis flares.
PMC3103669|S43|Interventions,Randomization Type|Eligible patients were subsequently randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1:2 to receive a single dose of canakinumab, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg on day 1, or four canakinumab doses administered at 4-weekly intervals (50 mg on day 1 and at week 4, and 25 mg at weeks 8 and 12), or daily oral doses of colchicine 0.5 mg given for 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S44|Blinding Procedure,Similarity of Interventions|In order to achieve blinding for patients and investigators, all patients received subcutaneous injections of canakinumab or canakinumab placebo on day 1, and at weeks 4, 8 and 12, and took capsules of colchicine or colchicine placebo daily for 16 weeks (see supplementary material for details).
PMC3103669|S45|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Patients were followed for 24 weeks.
PMC3103669|S46|Interventions|Allopurinol treatment (100–300 mg) was initiated at baseline or within 1 month before baseline and was administered to all randomised patients once daily for 24 weeks (see supplementary material for details).
PMC3103669|S47|Interventions|Patients could receive rescue medication as needed (see supplementary material for details).
PMC3103669|S49|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion criteria were: age 18–80 years, diagnosis of gouty arthritis as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 1977 preliminary criteria,29 having had at least two gouty arthritis flares in the previous year, body mass index (BMI) of ≤40 kg/m2 and willingness to initiate allopurinol treatment or having initiated allopurinol treatment within 1 month of screening.
PMC3103669|S50|Eligibility Criteria|Key exclusion criteria were: having a gouty arthritis flare within 2 weeks of screening, present at screening, or having pain associated with a flare at screening; history of allergy, contraindication, or intolerance to allopurinol or colchicine (see supplementary material for further details).
PMC3103669|S52|Outcomes|Flares were patient reported.
PMC3103669|S53|Outcomes|For each flare, patients recorded in a diary the start date, the most affected joint on that day and the severity of pain (see supplementary material for further details).
PMC3103669|S54|Outcomes|Patients also recorded rescue medication use and pain for at least 7 days after the onset of the flare or longer if the flares persisted for more than 7 days.
PMC3103669|S55|Outcomes|Safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits (2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks) and included collection of blood samples for assessment of the inflammatory marker, C reactive protein (CRP), haematology and immunogenicity (at baseline and weeks 8, 16 and 24) and doctor's assessments of local tolerability at sites of subcutaneous injections.
PMC3103669|S56|Outcomes|Adverse events (AEs) were reported throughout the study.
PMC3103669|S57|Outcomes|The primary outcome was determination of the canakinumab dose producing equivalent efficacy to that achieved with colchicine 0.5 mg, with respect to the mean number of flares per patient occurring within 16 weeks post randomisation (ie, the target dose).
PMC3103669|S58|Outcomes|Secondary efficacy outcomes included: mean number of flares per patient, proportion of patients with at least one flare, time to first flare, average duration of flares and CRP levels (see supplementary material for further details).
PMC3103669|S59|Outcomes|Safety variables included the incidence of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and infectious AEs, the incidence and severity of injection-site reactions, and immunogenicity.
PMC3103669|S61|Sample Size Determination|A sample size of 350 patients (50 patients in each of the 5 canakinumab single-dose groups and 100 patients in the colchicine group) was considered sufficient to give a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the target dose with reasonable precision.
PMC3103669|S62|Sample Size Determination|In order to increase the precision of the analysis the planned total sample size of 400 was increased to approximately 440 patients (see supplementary material for more details).
PMC3103669|S63|Outcomes,Interim Analyses/Stopping Guidelines|A preplanned interim analysis was performed when 200 patients had completed 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S64|Outcomes|Efficacy and safety analyses were then performed when all patients had completed the study (24 weeks).
PMC3103669|S65|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|For determination of the primary outcome, the number of flares per patient during 16 weeks was modelled using a negative binomial distribution and a common overdispersion (variance divided by expectation minus 1) for all treatment arms (see supplementary material for more details).
PMC3103669|S66|Outcomes|The main secondary outcome was the mean number of flares per patient at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S67|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Data were analysed according to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group, allopurinol dose at baseline and BMI at baseline as covariates.
PMC3103669|S68|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|However, as the distribution of flares per patient was observed to be skewed, the preplanned ANCOVA was considered inappropriate for these data.
PMC3103669|S69|Statistical Methods for Other Analyses|Therefore a post hoc analysis using a negative binomial model with treatment group, allopurinol dose at baseline and BMI at baseline as covariates and log (time on study) as an offset was performed with an adjustment made for multiplicity (see supplementary material for further details of analyses for secondary outcomes).
PMC3103669|S72|Participant Flow|Between December 2008 and August 2009, 432 patients from 75 centres in 16 countries were randomised to treatment; 391 patients (90.5%) completed the study (figure 1).
PMC3103669|S73|Baseline Data|Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced across treatment groups (table 1).
PMC3103669|S74|Baseline Data|Most patients were men (89% to 100%) and 28% to 44% had had gouty arthritis for at least 10 years.
PMC3103669|S75|Baseline Data|At baseline, many patients had very high SU levels (≥9 mg/dl; 35% to 55%).
PMC3103669|S76|Baseline Data|The mean number of flares in the past year ranged from 3.6 to 4.7 for the different treatment groups.
PMC3103669|S77|Baseline Data|Approximately 6% of patients had reduced renal function, defined as having an estimated creatinine clearance rate (CrCl) below the normal range for age and sex (table 1).
PMC3103669|S78|Participant Flow|Figure 1 Patient disposition.
PMC3103669|S79|Data Collection Setting|Patients were recruited from the following countries (number of centres): Argentina (1), Belgium (2), Columbia (5), Czech Republic (5), Germany (5), Guatemala (5), Hungary (4), Poland (2), Portugal (3), Russia (7), Singapore (1), Slovakia (6), South Africa (4), Spain (4), Taiwan (4), Turkey (8), UK (2) and USA (20).
PMC3103669|S80|Baseline Data|Table 1 Demographic and baseline characteristics (safety set)
PMC3103669|S82|Outcome Results|No evidence of a dose-response was seen in any of the four predefined dose response models.
PMC3103669|S83|Outcome Results|The estimated canakinumab dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of canakinumab doses tested.
PMC3103669|S86|Outcome Results|The least-squares (LS) mean number of flares per patient for the 16 weeks (according to the preplanned ANCOVA) was lower for all canakinumab doses compared with colchicine 0.5 mg; differences were statistically significant for the canakinumab 100 mg and 300 mg doses (p≤0.05, table 2).
PMC3103669|S87|Outcome Results|(The LS mean number of flares per patient is the best-fitting unbiased estimate calculated from the ANCOVA model.) However, as the distribution of flares per patient was observed to be skewed (most patients had no or few flares and few had many flares), the preplanned ANCOVA was considered inappropriate for these data.
PMC3103669|S88|Ancillary Analyses|Therefore a post hoc analysis using a negative binomial model (the model used for the primary outcome) was performed after unblinding at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S89|Outcome Results|According to this analysis, there was a 62% to 72% reduction in the mean number of flares per patient for canakinumab doses ≥50 mg versus colchicine (rate ratio: 0.28–0.38, p≤0.0083) (table 2).
PMC3103669|S90|Ancillary Analyses,Outcome Results|Table 2 Summary of efficacy parameters at 16 weeks (full analysis set)
PMC3103669|S91|Binary Outcome Results|The percentage of patients experiencing at least one flare in the 16-week period was lower for all canakinumab groups versus colchicine 0.5 mg (canakinumab, 15% to 27%; colchicine, 44%, p≤0.05), and all patients receiving canakinumab were significantly less likely to experience at least one flare compared with patients treated with colchicine (estimated odds ratio (OR) vs colchicine: 0.22–0.47, p≤0.05) (table 2).
PMC3103669|S92|Outcome Results,Binary Outcome Results|In addition, time to first new gouty arthritis flare was longer with all canakinumab groups compared with colchicine 0.5 mg (figure 2) and there was a 64% to 72% reduction in the risk of experiencing at least one flare for canakinumab doses ≥50 mg versus colchicine at 16 weeks (HR: 0.28–0.36, p≤0.05) (table 2).
PMC3103669|S93|Outcome Results|The average duration (LS mean) for all flares over the 16-week period was shorter in all canakinumab groups compared with colchicine 0.5 mg: 2.8–4.6 days versus 5.1 days (table 2).
PMC3103669|S94|Outcome Results|Differences in average duration between all canakinumab groups versus colchicine 0.5 mg, however, were not statistically significant.
PMC3103669|S95|Outcome Results|Figure 2 Time to first acute gouty arthritis flare after randomisation (Kaplan–Meier estimate).
PMC3103669|S97|Outcome Results|An initial decrease in median CRP levels was seen in all treatment groups (figure 3).
PMC3103669|S98|Outcome Results|For all canakinumab doses ≥50 mg, median CRP values remained consistently lower than in the colchicine group throughout the study and were below the upper limit of the normal range (ULN, 3.0 mg/dl) up to week 24.
PMC3103669|S99|Outcome Results|Figure 3 Median C reactive protein levels over time.
PMC3103669|S102|Baseline Data|At baseline, 85.2% to 92.6% of patients had SU levels ≥6 mg/dl (table 1).
PMC3103669|S103|Binary Outcome Results|At 16 weeks 38.9% to 53.7% of patients treated with canakinumab and 46.3% of patients treated with colchicine achieved SU levels <6 mg/dl and similar results were reported for week 24 (canakinumab, 37.0% to 50.9%; colchicine, 41.7%).
PMC3103669|S105|Harms|Safety results for the individual dose groups are summarised in table 3.
PMC3103669|S106|Harms|The incidence of AEs over the 24-week period was similar across the six canakinumab groups (51.9% to 58.5%) and for the colchicine group (53.7%) (table 3).
PMC3103669|S107|Harms|Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and there was no evidence of a dose-response for any AE.
PMC3103669|S108|Harms|SAEs were reported in 14 (4.3%) patients treated with canakinumab and 6 (5.6%) patients treated with colchicine; 2 were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study medication: erysipelas of the left leg in the canakinumab 25 mg group and cancer of the right kidney in the colchicine group.
PMC3103669|S109|Harms|One death occurred in the colchicine group, a possible myocardial infarction, but was not regarded by the investigator as being related to study medication.
PMC3103669|S110|Harms|Five further patients discontinued due to SAEs (canakinumab, n=4 (1.2%); colchicine, n=1 (0.9%)).
PMC3103669|S111|Harms|Infectious AEs were reported in 58 (18.0%) patients receiving canakinumab and 13 (12.0%) patients receiving colchicine 0.5 mg (table 3).
PMC3103669|S112|Harms|There was no clear pattern with respect to the incidence of infections with either treatment.
PMC3103669|S113|Harms|The only infections occurring in more than 1% of patients receiving canakinumab were upper respiratory tract infections (3.7%), nasopharyngitis (3.7%) and influenza (1.2%).
PMC3103669|S114|Harms|Upper respiratory tract infections (3.7%) and cystitis (1.9%) were the only infections occurring in more than 1% of patients receiving colchicine.
PMC3103669|S115|Harms|Six serious infections (erysipelas, gangrene, sepsis, tonsillitis, ear infection and pneumonia) were reported in four patients receiving canakinumab (table 3).
PMC3103669|S116|Harms|Only the case of erysipelas was considered to be possibly related to study medication.
PMC3103669|S117|Harms|No serious infections were reported in patients receiving colchicine.
PMC3103669|S118|Harms|Injection-site reactions were reported in 20 (6.2%) patients treated with canakinumab and 4 (3.7%) patients in the colchicine group.
PMC3103669|S119|Harms|All events were mild except for one moderate event in the canakinumab 50 mg group.
PMC3103669|S120|Harms|One patient (in the 50 mg group) developed low levels of anti-canakinumab antibodies at week 24.
PMC3103669|S121|Harms|Table 3 Adverse events (safety set)
PMC3103669|S126|Interpretation|Target SU levels (<6 mg/dl) were achieved in 39% to 54% of patients treated with canakinumab and 46% of patients treated with colchicine at 16 weeks, consistent with results of other recent studies of allopurinol treatment in patients who were hyperuricaemic.17 21 22
PMC3103669|S127|Interpretation|All canakinumab doses were well tolerated.
PMC3103669|S128|Interpretation|These results suggest that canakinumab can provide effective prophylaxis against gouty arthritis flares and is well tolerated in patients initiating ULT.
PMC3103669|S129|Interpretation|The results of this study validate the concept that IL-1β is a key mediator in the generation of acute gouty arthritis flares and hence an appropriate therapeutic target for treatment of acute gouty arthritis and prevention of flares.
PMC3103669|S135|Interpretation|However, no dose-response was evident with respect to the primary endpoint and the estimated dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of canakinumab doses tested.
PMC3103669|S136|Interpretation|Results of secondary outcomes indicated that single canakinumab doses of 50–300 mg or 4-weekly doses given over 4 months have similar efficacy across all clinical endpoints assessed and are superior to colchicine 0.5 mg.
PMC3103669|S137|Interpretation|The results of this study suggest that canakinumab may provide effective prophylaxis against flares in patients initiating ULT when given at doses lower than those used to treat acute gouty arthritis flares.
PMC3103669|S138|Interpretation|Accumulating data thus suggest that canakinumab is an effective new treatment option for patients with gouty arthritis and may be particularly valuable for patients with difficult-to-treat disease.
PMC3103669|S139|Generalizability|Such patients frequently have comorbidities and may be unable to receive standard anti-inflammatory therapies.5
PMC3103669|S141|Generalizability|This suggests that canakinumab is an effective treatment for acute gouty arthritis in patients with limited treatment options due to comorbidities.
PMC3103669|S143|Interpretation|Canakinumab was generally well tolerated.
PMC3103669|S155|Limitations|First, colchicine 0.5 mg was only given for 16 weeks.
PMC3103669|S156|Limitations|The risk of flares following initiation of ULT is known to extend for up to a year or longer; thus a more prolonged period of colchicine prophylaxis may have been appropriate.
PMC3103669|S158|Limitations|Second, occurrence and duration of flares was dependent on patients’ assessment.
PMC3103669|S159|Limitations|This reflects the fact that there are currently no validated endpoints for the assessment of gouty arthritis flares.
PMC3103669|S161|Interpretation|The endpoints used in our study overlap with those suggested by OMERACT and use of patient self-reporting for flares is unlikely to have had an impact on the results.
PMC3103669|S162|Limitations|Third, the study population is probably not representative of all patients who would benefit from canakinumab.
PMC3103669|S164|Limitations|Fourth, allopurinol treatment was initiated at 300 mg (or 100 mg or 200 mg if creatinine clearance was <90 ml/min) instead of slowly up-titrating from a dose of 50–100 mg, as suggested in treatment recommendations.12 33
PMC3103669|S165|Limitations|This may have increased the risk of flares compared with a dose-titration strategy.
PMC3103669|S167|Interpretation|In conclusion, in this double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre study assessing prophylaxis against gouty arthritis flares during the initiation of ULT, a single canakinumab dose of 50–300 mg or 4-weekly dosing over 4 months provided effective prophylaxis against flares, was superior to the standard of care (colchicine) and was well tolerated.

PMC4515982|S35|Background|In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the cerebrospinal fluid EPO level was lower than in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, and its concentration was suggested to correlate with the progression of the disease.11

PMC4515982|S43|Eligibility Criteria|Inclusion criteria were onset of weakness ≤18 months and slow vital capacity (sVC) ≥70% of predicted in seated position at screening visit.
PMC4515982|S44|Eligibility Criteria|Exclusion criteria were haematocrit >51% in men and >49% in women, haemoglobin value >17 g/dL; non-invasive ventilation (NIV) >6 h daily; known familial ALS or first-degree relative with ALS; diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia; history and/or instrumental evidence of previous thrombotic vascular event or cardiac diseases; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic ≥160 mm Hg and diastolic ≥95 mm Hg irrespective of treatments at two consecutive evaluations); active solid or myeloproliferative malignancy; known hypercoagulable disorders.
PMC4515982|S46|Eligibility Criteria|Patients who did not take riluzole at the screening visit were considered eligible and could be randomized; in this case, they could not start riluzole during the entire study period.
PMC4515982|S50|Outcomes|The primary outcome was one single composite outcome of time from randomisation to death, tracheotomy or >23 h NIV daily for 14 consecutive days.
PMC4515982|S51|Outcomes|Secondary outcomes were changed from baseline in the ALSFRS-R score, sVC in the seated position and patients’ quality of life measured by the ALSAQ-40 questionnaire.
PMC4515982|S52|Outcomes|Tolerability was evaluated analysing adverse events (AEs) causing withdrawal.
PMC4515982|S54|Interventions|Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous rhEPO 40 000 IU or matching placebo (1:1 ratio) fortnightly for 12 months.
PMC4515982|S55|Randomization Type|Randomisation was stratified by centre, disease severity (ALSFRS-R ≤33 vs >33) and onset (spinal or bulbar), with a block size of four within each centre.
PMC4515982|S56|Random Allocation Sequence Generation,Allocation Concealment Mechanism,Randomization Implementation|The Neuroepidemiology Unit at the coordinating centre, independent of the study, generated the computer-based randomisation sequence known only to two staff persons and the drug dispenser.
PMC4515982|S57|Randomization Implementation|Treatment was allocated by a web-based randomisation system, available 24 h a day.
PMC4515982|S61|Similarity of Interventions|RhEPO (Eprex) was purchased from Janssen-Cilag SpA (Cologno Monzese, Italy) by the coordinating centre and directly shipped to the company (Pierrel Research IMP srl, Cantù, Italy) in charge of preparing the investigational drug (rhEPO or 1 cc of saline) in syringes of identical appearance, sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence.
PMC4515982|S62|Interventions|Shipping was performed for each patient within 1 week after randomisation using a refrigerated express carrier.
PMC4515982|S63|Interventions|Each centre stored the investigational drug at −4°C.
PMC4515982|S64|Blinding Procedure|Patients, neurologists, laboratory biologists/technicians (two at each centre) and a statistician were masked to treatment allocation and did not have access to any data related to rhEPO haematopoietic activity.
PMC4515982|S66|Randomization Implementation|At each treatment visit, the local laboratory unit received the de-identified vial reporting the randomisation number before treatment administration.
PMC4515982|S68|Blinding Procedure|Patients and treating neurologists did not have access to any data on blood parameters, whereas laboratory personnel did not have access to any data allowing the identification of the patient.
PMC4515982|S71|Blinding Procedure|Therefore, the randomisation centre generated a list of placebo patients randomly assigned to 1 week treatment delay balanced with the number of patients allocated on rhEPO treatment needing true delay at each centre.
PMC4515982|S74|Outcomes|After giving informed written consent, eligible patients underwent haematological examinations (haemochromocytometry, renal and liver function, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, reticulocyte count, coagulation tests), blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) measurement and sVC, ALSFR-R and ALSQ40 assessment.
PMC4515982|S76|Outcomes|At each fortnightly treatment visit, safety parameters (haematocrit >51% in men and >49% in women or haemoglobin value >17 g/dL and value raised >1 g/dL at the end of the interval between two subsequent doses), blood pressure and BMI were assessed.
PMC4515982|S77|Outcomes|Symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation (nocturnal arousals, morning headache, excessive daytime sleepiness, vivid dreams), medications and AE were actively monitored and recorded.
PMC4515982|S78|Outcomes|ALSFR-R and sVC were assessed monthly.
PMC4515982|S79|Outcomes|At the 6-month and study end or dropout visit, the patient also underwent complete haematological examinations and ALSAQ-40 assessment.
PMC4515982|S80|Interventions|At each treatment visit, treatment administration was allowed or delayed for 1 week by the trial coordinating office after assessment of safety parameters.
PMC4515982|S81|Interventions|If treatment was delayed, the following week safety parameters were repeated before drug administration.
PMC4515982|S82|Participant Loss and Exclusion|The delay of treatment administration for more than two times caused the dropout of the patient.
PMC4515982|S83|Outcomes|After the study end at month 12, patients underwent monthly follow-up visits for a further 6 months to record primary outcome events.
PMC4515982|S84|Outcomes|All centres were provided with a spirometer (Spirobank G multifunction, Medisan srl, Milano, Italy) and disposable tubes for sVC assessment, and trained in its use.
PMC4515982|S90|Interventions|We agreed that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or an equivalent device should be proposed to all patients in the case of score 1 or 2 at item 3 of the ALSFRS-R, unintentional loss of body weight >10% in the past 3 months or choking during food, liquids or medication ingestion.
PMC4515982|S91|Interventions|NIV should be proposed to all patients in the case of score 0 or 1 at item 10 or 11 of the ALSFRS-R, sVC<50% or abnormal nocturnal oximetry (SaO2 <90% for 4% of the overnight recorded time).
PMC4515982|S93|Sample Size Determination|On the basis of the results of our pilot study (ie, observed rates of 0.56 for death and 0.33 for tracheotomy at 18 months in the placebo group),13 we estimated that we would need a sample size of 203 patients followed up for 12 months to give 97% power to detect a significant difference between rhEPO and placebo corresponding to a 67% relative reduction of risk of death and 74% power to detect a 70% relative reduction of risk of respiratory events (tracheotomy or >23 h NIV), with a two-sided type 1 error of 5% and given an anticipated dropout rate of 10%.
PMC4515982|S99|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Time from randomisation to death, tracheotomy or >23 h NIV daily for 14 consecutive days was analysed in terms of the annualised rate with the corresponding 95% CI, and p value using a χ2 test with one degree of freedom for rate comparison (based on Poisson regression).
PMC4515982|S100|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain survival curves with the corresponding log-rank test.
PMC4515982|S101|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|A Cox model was applied to estimate the treatment effect in terms of HR with 95% CI, adjusted for sex, age, ALSFRS-R score at baseline and disease duration.
PMC4515982|S102|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|The number of patients experiencing an AE causing withdrawal were reported and compared between the two groups by Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to withdrawal and the corresponding log-rank test.
PMC4515982|S103|Statistical Methods for Outcome Comparison|Change from baseline in sVC, ALSFRS-R and ALSAQ-40 was assayed by mixed effect models.
PMC4515982|S105|Registry/Number|This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2009-016066-91 (EPOS trial).
PMC4515982|S107|Recruitment Period/Follow-Up|Between August 2010 and November 2012, 208 of 545 eligible patients (38%) were randomly allocated to the treatment arms (104 in the rhEPO arm and 104 in the placebo arm; figure 1).
PMC4515982|S109|Baseline Data|Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the treatment groups at baseline.
PMC4515982|S110|Numbers Analyzed,Outcome Results|In the analysis of the primary outcome performed on all patients who received at least one dose of the interventional treatment (eg, 103 patients in the rhEPO arm and 97 patients in the placebo arm), the rate of events (death, tracheotomy, >23 h NIV) at 12-month follow-up did not differ between the treatment groups, even after stratification by disease severity and onset (table 2).
PMC4515982|S111|Outcome Results|The Kaplan-Meier analysis did not disclose any difference in terms of the log-rank test (p=0.99; figure 3) and Peto test (p=0.89).
PMC4515982|S112|Outcome Results|The corresponding HR between rhEPO and placebo, adjusted for gender, age, ALSFRS-R score and disease duration, was 1.02 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.83).
PMC4515982|S113|Outcome Results|The analysis of efficacy by intention-to-treat performed on all randomised patients (eg, 104 patients in the rhEPO and placebo groups) yielded the same results.

PMC4515982|S122|Outcome Results|Survival probability in terms of death, tracheotomy and 23 h non-invasive ventilation for 14 consecutive days during the 12 months of the EPOS trial, with the corresponding p value of the log-rank test.
PMC4515982|S123|Outcome Results|The percentage of AE causing withdrawal was twice as high in the rhEPO (16.5%) group as in the placebo (8.3%) group, although the difference was not significant in terms of the log-rank test (p=0.16), most likely due to the small number of events (table 3; figure 4).
PMC4515982|S124|Harms|In the rhEPO group, we recorded four cases of deep venous thrombosis complicated in two cases by pulmonary embolism, two cases of cardiac arrhythmia, four cases of treatment suspension for >8 weeks and seven cases of delay more than two times due to altered safety parameters.
PMC4515982|S125|Harms|In the placebo group, we recorded one case of deep venous thrombosis, one case of cardiac infarction, four cases of treatment suspension for >8 weeks and two cases of delay more than two times due to altered safety parameters (table 3).
PMC4515982|S129|Outcome Results|The analysis of the secondary outcomes during the 12 months of follow-up did not show differences between groups either in ALSFRS-R (p of mixed-effects models=0.31) and sVC (p of mixed-effects models=0.47) decline (figure 5) or ALSAQ-40 score (+29 points in the rhEPO group and +37 points in the placebo group from baseline to 12 months; p of mixed-effects models=0.23).
PMC4515982|S132|Ancillary Analyses|All the above analyses were also performed for the subgroups of patients with ALSFRS-R ≥33 or <33 at randomisation and with spinal or bulbar onset, and per-protocol, and did not show any significant difference between the two treatment groups (data not shown).
PMC4515982|S133|Outcome Results|Haemoglobin and haematocrit values overlapped in the rhEPO and placebo groups at baseline, whereas they were significantly (p<0.01) higher in the rhEPO group than the placebo group throughout the entire study period (figure 6).
PMC4515982|S135|Outcome Results|At baseline, haemoglobin and haematocrit values overlapped, whereas they were significantly higher (p<0.01) in the rhEPO group than in the placebo group at 3, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-up.
PMC4515982|S136|Binary Outcome Results|At 18-month follow-up, 6 months after the treatment was stopped, 41 (41%; 3 lost to follow-up) of 100 patients in the rhEPO group and 31 (33.3%; 4 lost to follow-up) of 93 placebo patients reached the primary outcome (death or tracheotomy).
PMC4515982|S141|Interpretation|Conversely, our study demonstrated that rhEPO administered at the dose of 40 000 IU fortnightly did not change either survival or disability at 12 months.
PMC4515982|S142|Interpretation|Patients’ demographic and clinical features were well balanced between the treatment arms, supporting the reliability of the results.
PMC4515982|S143|Interpretation|The significant and stable increase of haemoglobin and haematocrit values in the rhEPO group throughout the entire treatment period demonstrated that rhEPO exerted its expected haematological effects, and therefore it was not degraded in patients with ALS.
PMC4515982|S144|Interpretation|This observation strengthens our negative findings, suggesting that the lack of neuroprotective effect could not be attributed to an altered biological activity of rhEPO at the haematological level.
PMC4515982|S145|Interpretation|Our negative findings appear to be in keeping with those disappointing from previous clinical studies investigating rhEPO neuroprotection in critical illness and patients with stroke.1
PMC4515982|S146|Interpretation|RhEPO may remain a promising treatment in schizophrenia19 and in the prevention of cognitive impairment after cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass,20 though these preliminary data need larger confirmatory studies.
PMC4515982|S147|Interpretation|Therefore, despite the bulk of preclinical findings in favour of a substantial protective activity of EPO outside the bone marrow, no evidence is currently available to support the hypothesis that rhEPO can rescue injured neurons in patients with acute or chronic progressive neurological diseases like stroke and ALS.
PMC4515982|S150|Limitations|One limitation may appear to be the lack of a previous dose-finding study.
PMC4515982|S154|Interpretation|In our study, it did not significantly increase the rate of thrombotic complications compared with the placebo group, most likely due to the small number of events, being the overall number of AEs twice as high as in the rhEPO treated group.
PMC4515982|S156|Limitations|A recent reappraisal of patients’ clinical features included in ALS trials suggested that the intrinsic limitations imposed by a classical randomised clinical trial can lead to the exclusion of patients representing the ALS population in clinical practice, reducing the reliability of the results.23
PMC4515982|S160|Interpretation|However, the mean age of ALS onset was slightly lower than that recorded in epidemiological studies,24–27 possibly accounting for the lower 1-year death rates.
PMC4515982|S162|Interpretation|In particular, in the pilot study, we had observed a higher prevalence of primary outcome events (death and tracheotomy) in the placebo group at 18 months follow-up, most likely a chance result due to the small sample size.
PMC4515982|S164|Interpretation|Our phase III randomised trial demonstrated that rhEPO does not have any positive effect on the course of ALS, lengthening the list of disappointing results from all the previous studies.28–37

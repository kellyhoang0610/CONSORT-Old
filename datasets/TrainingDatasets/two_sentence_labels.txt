PMC3671111|S132|7a|Sample Size Determination|Sample size|However, there was no formal sample size power calculation for this study.
PMC3671244|S108|11a|Blinding Procedure|Blinding|The study was single blinded: the research assistant who acquired the data (IM) was blinded for group allocation.
PMC3671244|S109|11a|Blinding Procedure|Blinding|It was not possible to blind professionals for group allocation.
PMC3672794|S70|3a|Trial Design|Study design|This study is a part of a previously reported randomized controlled exercise study, studying the effects of a moderate-to-high-intensity Nordic walking (NW) program and a supervised low-intensity walking (LIW) program.
PMC3672794|S71|3a|Trial Design|Study design|The effects of Nordic walking on body function were reported previously [63], showing that NW resulted in better improvement in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and aerobic capacity, when compared with LIW.

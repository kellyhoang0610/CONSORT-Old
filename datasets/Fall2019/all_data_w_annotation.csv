PMC3103669,S56,6a,Adverse events (AEs) were reported throughout the study.
PMC3103669,S57,6a,"The primary outcome was determination of the canakinumab dose producing equivalent efficacy to that achieved with colchicine 0.5 mg, with respect to the mean number of flares per patient occurring within 16 weeks post randomisation (ie, the target dose)."
PMC3103669,S58,6a,"Secondary efficacy outcomes included: mean number of flares per patient, proportion of patients with at least one flare, time to first flare, average duration of flares and CRP levels (see supplementary material for further details)."
PMC3103669,S59,6a,"Safety variables included the incidence of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and infectious AEs, the incidence and severity of injection-site reactions, and immunogenicity."
PMC3103669,S61,7a,A sample size of 350 patients (50 patients in each of the 5 canakinumab single-dose groups and 100 patients in the colchicine group) was considered sufficient to give a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the target dose with reasonable precision.
PMC3103669,S62,7a,In order to increase the precision of the analysis the planned total sample size of 400 was increased to approximately 440 patients (see supplementary material for more details).
PMC3103669,S63,"6a,7b",A preplanned interim analysis was performed when 200 patients had completed 16 weeks.
PMC3103669,S64,6a,Efficacy and safety analyses were then performed when all patients had completed the study (24 weeks).
PMC3103669,S65,12a,"For determination of the primary outcome, the number of flares per patient during 16 weeks was modelled using a negative binomial distribution and a common overdispersion (variance divided by expectation minus 1) for all treatment arms (see supplementary material for more details)."
PMC3103669,S66,6a,The main secondary outcome was the mean number of flares per patient at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669,S67,12a,"Data were analysed according to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group, allopurinol dose at baseline and BMI at baseline as covariates."
PMC3103669,S68,12a,"However, as the distribution of flares per patient was observed to be skewed, the preplanned ANCOVA was considered inappropriate for these data."
PMC3103669,S69,12b,"Therefore a post hoc analysis using a negative binomial model with treatment group, allopurinol dose at baseline and BMI at baseline as covariates and log (time on study) as an offset was performed with an adjustment made for multiplicity (see supplementary material for further details of analyses for secondary outcomes)."
PMC3109952,S38,"3a,4b","This multicentre, two arm, randomised, controlled, open trial was carried out in 13 centres in the United Kingdom and one in the Republic of Ireland."
PMC3109952,S40,4a,"Participants were eligible for the study if they were aged 12 years or over and had a plantar wart (verruca) that, in the opinion of a healthcare professional, was suitable for treatment with both salicylic acid and cryotherapy."
PMC3109952,S41,4a,"Participants were excluded from the study if they had impaired healing (such as from diabetes or peripheral vascular disease); were immunosuppressed (such as agammaglobulinaemia) or were taking immunosuppressant drugs (such as oral corticosteroids); had neuropathy; were receiving renal dialysis; had cold intolerance (such as Raynaudâ€™s syndrome or cold urticaria); had any of the following conditions (blood dyscrasias of unknown origin, cryoglobulinaemia, cryofibrinogenaemia, collagen or autoimmune disease); were unable to give informed consent; or were currently in a trial evaluating other treatments for their plantar wart."

PMC3109952,S44,0,Eligible participants gave written informed consent.
PMC3109952,S45,0,They were then randomised equally to receive cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or daily self treatment with an over the counter 50% salicylic acid treatment.
PMC3109952,S46,"9,10","Randomisation was performed by a member of the research team either telephoning an independent, secure, remote, telephone randomisation service (York Trials Unit) or accessing a secure online web randomisation programme, thereby concealing treatment allocation until the moment of randomisation."

PMC3109952,S50,5,Participants randomised to cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen received a maximum of four treatments given two to three weeks apart by a healthcare professional.
PMC3109952,S51,5,The liquid nitrogen was applied with a spray (method of choice if available) or a probe.
PMC3109952,S52,5,"The treatment was delivered according to the siteâ€™s usual practice (such as debridement before treatment, masking of the surrounding area, and padding after treatment)."
PMC3109952,S53,5,"On advice from the trial steering committee, sites were advised that the first treatment should be a â€œgentle freezeâ€ù in order to ensure the participant could tolerate the treatment."
PMC3109952,S55,5,"Participants randomised to self treatment with 50% salicylic acid (Verrugon, William Ransom and Son) were instructed how to apply the treatment according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions by the treating healthcare professional."
PMC3109952,S56,5,Patients were directed to fix the adhesive ring with the hole over the verruca and to squeeze a little ointment into the hole and directly on to the verruca.
PMC3109952,S57,5,The backing paper from the plaster was then removed and the plaster applied to cover the ring completely.
PMC3109952,S58,5,The plaster was then sealed into position.
PMC3109952,S59,5,The treatment was repeated daily after gently pumicing or filing off the dead part of the verruca for a maximum of eight weeks.
PMC3109952,S62,6a,The primary outcome was complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after randomisation.
PMC3109952,S63,6a,Clearance of plantar wart was defined as the restoration of normal skin on close inspection.
PMC3109952,S64,6a,Digital photographs of the plantar wart(s) were taken at baseline and at the outcome assessment.
PMC3109952,S65,"6a,11a",The photographs were assessed by two assessors who were blind to treatment allocation.
PMC3109952,S66,6a,They independently assessed the photographs for each participant to determine whether the plantar wart had cleared.
PMC3109952,S67,6a,Any discrepancies were referred to a third assessor.
PMC3109952,S68,6a,"If no photographs were available for a participant, however, then the blinded outcome assessment undertaken at the site was used."
PMC3109952,S69,6a,"If neither of these were available for a participant, the patientâ€™s self reported outcome recorded in the week 12 patient questionnaire or on the â€œVerrucae gone formâ€ù was used."
PMC3109952,S71,6a,"Secondary outcomes included (a) complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after controlling for age, whether the plantar wart had been treated previously, and type of wart and (b) a second model to explore the effect of patient preferences, (c) with clearance of plantar wart at six months, (d) number of warts at 12 weeks, (e) time to clearance of wart, (f) patient satisfaction with the treatment, and (g) adverse events."

PMC3109952,S75,0,"This poor quality study found a 58% cure rate among the patients allocated to cryotherapy, compared with 41% among those treated with salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S76,0,This difference of 17% was not statistically significant.
PMC3109952,S77,0,"The overall cure rates from this study are smaller than those observed in two placebo controlled trials of salicylic acid, both of which reported cure rates of 85% for active treatment, possibly because more resistant verrucae were included in the study comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S78,0,This trial was a superiority study of cryotherapy compared with salicylic acid and was powered to show a 15% difference in effectiveness.
PMC3109952,S79,7a,"In order to give 80% power (5% two sided significance) to show a difference in cure rates of 70% for salicylic acid versus 85% for cryotherapy at 12 weeks, a sample size of 120 patients in each treatment group was required, or 133 patients in each group after allowing for 10% attrition (266 patients in total)."

PMC3109952,S84,12a,The primary analysis compared the clearance rate of all plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two randomised groups using a Ï‡2 test.
PMC3109952,S85,12a,Cohenâ€™s Îº measure of inter-rater agreement was used to assess agreement between the two assessors of the photographs for clearance.
PMC3109952,S87,12a,"A logistic regression model was used to adjust the primary analysis for important prognostic variables (age, whether the plantar wart had been previously treated, and type of wart)."
PMC3109952,S88,12a,We also extended the primary outcome model to explore the effect of patient preferences by including preference and an interaction term between preferred treatment and randomised treatment.
PMC3109952,S89,12a,The complete clearance of all plantar warts at six months was analysed in the same way as the primary outcome with adjustments for the same covariates.
PMC3109952,S90,12a,We used negative binomial regression to compare the number of plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two treatment groups with adjustment for the number of plantar warts at baseline.
PMC3109952,S91,0,These models are used to estimate the number of occurrences of an event when the event has Poisson variation with over-dispersion.
PMC3109952,S92,6a,"The time to clearance of plantar warts was derived as the number of days from randomisation until the date of clearance, as detailed from the participantâ€™s self reported questionnaire."
PMC3109952,S93,0,"Participants whose plantar warts had not cleared were treated as censored, and we calculated their duration in the trial from their date of trial exit, date of last available assessment, or the 183 days to trial cessation, as appropriate."
PMC3109952,S94,12b,A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the time to clearance of plantar warts between the two groups adjusting for the same covariates as for the primary outcome.
PMC3109952,S95,12b,The Cox proportional hazard assumption was tested globally by the correlation of Schoenfeld residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time) and separately for each covariate through the correlation of Schoenfeld scaled residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time).
PMC3109952,S96,0,Non-significant correlation indicates that there is not enough evidence that the proportional hazard assumption has been violated.
PMC3109952,S97,0,Data on patient satisfaction with the treatment and adverse events were summarised by treatment group but no statistical analyses were performed.

PMC3348565,S91,7a,"Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005,12 and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies1,2 we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group."
PMC3348565,S92,7a,Thus a study with 80% power and 95% significance needed 22â€ˆ079 child-months per group (total of 2454 children for 18 months follow-up).
PMC3348565,S93,7a,Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up and allowing for protocol violations we intended to recruit 3050 children for 18 months follow-up.
PMC3348565,S94,12a,Data were entered into a Microsoft Access database (version 2007) and data processing and analysis was done in STATA (version 11.0).
PMC3348565,S95,0,We compared baseline characteristics and the distribution of our prestated confounders for intervention and placebo groups.
PMC3348565,S96,12a,To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables).
PMC3348565,S97,0,"If a child was not seen for more than 45 days, at the two weekly visits, or at the hospital, they were censored for that period of our study."

PMC3386495,S41,"4a,24",Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in detail in the protocol.13
PMC3386495,S42,4a,"Briefly, patients were eligible according to the following criteria: they had symp-toms and signs of clinically definite acute stroke; the time of stroke onset was known; treatment could be started within 6 h of onset; and CT or MRI had reliably excluded both intracranial haemorrhage and structural brain lesions, which could mimic stroke (eg, cerebral tumour)."
PMC3386495,S43,4a,"Additionally, if the patient had a clear indication for intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA, they were to be treated in accordance with local guidelines."
PMC3386495,S44,4a,"Equally, if the patient had a clear contraindication to treatment they were not to be entered in the trial."
PMC3386495,S45,4a,"Only if both the clinician and the patient (or a relevant proxy for the patient) felt that the treatment was promising but unproven, could the patient be included in the trial after appropriate informed consent from the patient or a valid proxy."
PMC3386495,S46,0,"The protocol was approved by the Multi-centre Research Ethics Committees, Scotland (reference MREC/99/0/78), and by local ethical committees."

PMC3386495,S49,15,Table 1 Baseline characteristics
PMC3386495,S50,10,Clinicians entered baseline data via a telephone voice-activated or a secure web-based randomisation system.
PMC3386495,S51,10,"After the system had recorded and checked the data, patients were allocated either immediate thrombolysis with 0Â·9 mg/kg of intravenous rt-PA to a maximum of 90 mg (10% bolus with the remainder over 1 h) or control treatment."
PMC3386495,S52,4a,The system would not accept patients with blood pressure or glucose levels outside protocol-defined criteria (appendix pp 4â€“5) or other data inconsistencies.
PMC3386495,S53,"10,8b","The system used a minimisation algorithm to achieve optimum balance for key prognostic factors (table 1), and from January, 2006, minimisation was additionally stratified by world region and then minimised on all the other key factors within regions."
PMC3386495,S54,0,"To be eligible to join the trial, participating hospitals had to have an organised system of stroke care."
PMC3386495,S55,0,"Acute-care protocols were not specified by the trial, but had to include the components of effective stroke-unit care,19 including, soon after admission, intravenous access, monitoring of physiological variables, correction of any abnormalities, and where clinically appropriate, intravenous-fluid therapy."
PMC3386495,S56,0,"All patients in the trial were to be treated within that organised system of stroke care, irrespective of treatment allocation."
PMC3386495,S57,5,Patients allocated to the control group were to avoid treatment with rt-PA and received stroke care in the same clinical environment as those allocated to the rt-PA group.
PMC3386495,S58,5,Both treatment groups had blood pressure monitored closely over the first 24 h.
PMC3386495,S59,5,"In the double-blinded phase, both groups were to avoid antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for 24 h."
PMC3386495,S60,5,"In the open phase, patients allocated to the control group were to start aspirin immediately."
PMC3386495,S61,0,"Blood pressure was managed in the same way in both treatment groups, according to local protocol."
PMC3386495,S62,0,"Additionally, all centres were asked for their pretrial experience of thrombolysis for treatment of stroke, and if the centre had, before joining the trial, a protocol for open-label use of rt-PA and had treated at least three people in the 12 months before joining the trial, the centre was classed as experienced."
PMC3386495,S63,6a,All patients had a CT or MRI brain scan before randomisation and a follow-up scan at 24â€“48 h.
PMC3386495,S64,6a,A repeat brain scan was required if the patient deteriorated neurologically or intracranial haemorrhage was suspected for any reason.
PMC3386495,S65,6a,"Although CT scanning was preferred, MRI was allowed."
PMC3386495,S66,"6a,11a","All scans were sent to the trial centre in Edinburgh for masked central rating of any signs of visible early ischaemia (presence and extent of hypo-attenuation, swelling, hyperattenuated artery), haemorrhage, and background brain changes (leukoaraiosis, atrophy, prior stroke lesions, non-stroke lesions) with validated rating methods.20â€“25"
PMC3386495,S67,"11a,6a","Images were assessed with all original identifiers stripped from the record, and then viewed via a secure web-based image viewing system by an international panel of expert radiologists."
PMC3386495,S68,11a,All assessments were made masked to all patient details and treatment allocation.
PMC3386495,S69,6a,"The primary outcome specified in version 1Â·93 of the protocol and in the published statistical analysis plan14 was the proportion of patients alive and independent as measured by the Oxford Handicap Score (OHS),26 a commonly used variant of the modified Rankin score.27"
PMC3386495,S70,6a,"Patients with an OHS of 0, 1, or 2 were classed as independent."
PMC3386495,S71,12a,The statistical analysis plan specified an ordinal analysis of the OHS score at 6 months.
PMC3386495,S72,0,Additional secondary outcomes were to be reported separately.
PMC3386495,S73,6a,"Events occurring within 7 days of stroke were recorded by the local trial clinician on the 7-day form: deaths subdivided by cause (swelling of the initial infarct, intracranial haemorrhage, other deaths from the initial stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, recurrent stroke of unknown type, any other cause); symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage; recurrent ischaemic stroke; recurrent stroke of unknown type; neurological deterioration attributed to swelling of the initial ischaemic stroke; neurological deterioration not attributable to swelling of the initial ischaemic stroke or haemorrhage; and major extracranial haemorrhage (operational definitions of each of these events are provided in the published protocol13 and statistical analysis plan14)."
PMC3386495,S74,6a,Other fatal and non-fatal non-cerebral events were also recorded and coded.
PMC3386495,S75,11a,Data on potential reports of any of these events were extracted from the trial database and presented to the adjudication committee who were masked to treatment allocation.
PMC3386495,S77,8a,"To avoid predictable alternation of treatment allocation, and thus potential loss of allocation concealment, patients were allocated with a probability of 0Â·80 to the treatment group that would minimise the difference between the groups on the key prognostic factors."
PMC3386495,S78,8a,Additional details of the procedures used in the double-blinded phase of the study are reported elsewhere.11
PMC3386495,S79,10,"The randomisation system informed local clinicians of the patients' unique trial identification number, and the weight-adjusted dose of drug or placebo in the double-blinded phase, or of the weight-adjusted drug dose among those allocated thrombolysis in the open phase, to be given as a 10% bolus with the remainder by an infusion over 1 h."
PMC3386495,S80,11a,"With the exception of the 276 patients treated in the double-blinded phase of the trial, treatment was given openly and neither the patient nor the treating clinicians were masked."
PMC3386495,S81,6a,"Hospital staff completed an early outcome form at 7 days, death, or hospital discharge, whichever occured first, recording details of events occurring in hospital within 7 days, details of background treatments given and functional status."
PMC3386495,S82,6a,"6 months after randomisation, general practitioners (or hospital coordinators) were contacted by the IST-3 trial office staff to check that the patient was alive and inform them that they might be approached for follow-up."
PMC3386495,S83,"11a,6a","If appropriate, the IST-3 trial office masked staff then mailed a postal questionnaire to patients to assess outcome."
PMC3386495,S84,6a,"Non-responders were contacted by telephone, and follow-up data was obtained by telephone interview."
PMC3386495,S85,"6a,11a","In Italy and Austria, all follow-ups were done as telephone interviews by a clinician, who was masked to treatment allocation and was highly experienced in outcome assessment."
PMC3386495,S86,"6a,11a","In Portugal, patients were followed up in clinic by clinicians not involved in the patients' initial treatment, again, masked to treatment allocation as far as possible."
PMC3386495,S87,6a,"To assess the durability of any treatment benefit beyond 6 months, patients recruited in the UK (and in other countries where appropriate funding had been obtained) were also followed up at 18 months."
PMC3386495,S88,6a,"All follow-up done by patient contact for these analyses ceased on March 31, 2012, but recording of deaths from national registries of deaths continues in UK, Norway, and Sweden."
PMC3386495,S90,7a,"At the outset of the trial in 2000, we estimated that, among the type of patients likely to be recruited at the time, to detect both an absolute difference of 10% in the proportion of patients alive and independent at 6 months after treatment and to have sufficient power to permit reliable analyses of the prespecified subgroups, a sample of 6000 patients would be needed."
PMC3386495,S91,7a,"A trial of that size could detect a clinically worthwhile net benefit of as little as 3% absolute difference in the primary outcome (80% power, Î±=0Â·05)."
PMC3386495,S92,3b,"However, it was clear by 2007 that obtaining a sample of 6000 was no longer feasible, and the Steering Committee agreed a revised recruitment target.11"
PMC3386495,S93,7a,"The sample size, re-estimated in 2007 on the basis of event rates in both treatment groups combined, was 3100."
PMC3386495,S94,7a,This sample size gave 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 4Â·7% in the primary outcome.11
PMC3386495,S95,0,"We monitored the quality and integrity of the accumulating clinical data according to a protocol agreed with the study sponsors, which involved central statistical monitoring according to the principles described by Buyse and colleagues,28 supplemented by onsite monitoring and detailed source data verification in a random sample of 10% of records in centres that had recruited more than 30 patients, or when patterns in the data at a centre seemed anomalous."
PMC3386495,S96,0,"All IST-3 monitoring procedures were compliant with requirements of all study sponsors, the national ethics committees and regulatory agencies in the 12 participating countries, and they met all appropriate regulatory and Good Clinical Practice requirements."
PMC3386495,S97,0,"All baseline data, 7-day, and 6-month outcome data were subject to verification checks built into the randomisation and data management system."
PMC3386495,S98,0,"We monitored all baseline and postrandomisation imaging, which provided additional cross-checks on recruited patients and centre performance."
PMC3386495,S99,0,"An expert radiologist checked all scans, masked to clinical details and treatment allocation, immediately on receipt at the trial office, for evidence of adverse events and protocol deviations."
PMC3386495,S100,7b,"The independent data monitoring committee met at least annually to review the unmasked data on major outcome events in the trial, on the background stroke-unit care received by trial patients (to ensure it was equal in both treatment groups), relevant external data (including updates of the Cochrane systematic review and reports from large-scale registries of rt-PA use) in strict confidence throughout the course of the trial."
PMC3386495,S101,7b,The committee judged these data never met the protocol-specified criteria to recommend modification of the protocol or halt recruitment to the study.
PMC3386495,S102,12a,The statistical analysis plan was published14 before unmasking of the authors to the data.
PMC3386495,S103,16,All randomly assigned patients were included in the analysis.
PMC3386495,S104,0,"Masked analysis of the patients' baseline characteristics showed clear differences in key prognostic factors (age, stroke severity, degree of ischaemic change on baseline CT or MRI) in patients randomly assigned at different times after stroke onset, which might complicate the estimation of the effect of treatment overall and in subgroups.11"
PMC3386495,S105,12a,"Therefore, the primary analysis of the effect of treatment on the primary outcome was adjusted by logistic regression for linear effects for the following covariates: age; National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score; time from onset of stroke symptoms to randomisation; and presence (vs absence) of ischaemic change on the prerandomisation brain scan according to expert assessment."
PMC3386495,S106,12b,An unadjusted analysis is also presented.
PMC3386495,S107,0,"The trial did not meet its original target of 6000 patients, and so was no longer adequately powered to detect a 3% absolute difference in the primary outcome (with 80% power and Î±=0Â·05)."
PMC3386495,S108,0,"The statistical-analysis-plan writing committee, which did not have access to the accumulating data, was therefore expanded to include an independent statistician (Gordon Murray, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK) to advise on the correct approach."
PMC3386495,S109,0,The writing group was persuaded by the recent empirical evidence that the ordinal method was both statistically more efficient (effectively reducing the sample size required in stroke trials29) and robust against substantial deviations from the proportional assumption.30
PMC3386495,S110,"6b,3b","We therefore specified in the statistical analysis plan an ordinal logistic regression analysis, as a secondary outcome, in which the OHS as a dependent variable had 5 levels: levels 4, 5, and 6 were combined into a single level and levels 0, 1, 2, 3 were retained as distinct."
PMC3386495,S111,12a,"In this model the treatment odds ratios between one level and the next were assumed to be constant, so a single parameter summarises the shift in outcome distribution between treatment and control groups."
PMC3386495,S112,6a,"For patients known to be alive at 6 months, but with an unknown OHS, we used the level of function recorded on the 7-day form (ie, measured at 7 days or before discharge from hospital) to impute 6-month functional status.14"
PMC3386495,S113,0,We chose this simple form of imputation because it effectively classified 6-month outcomes in patients for whom both 7-day and 6-month data were known (data not shown).
PMC3386495,S114,0,Analyses were done with SAS (version 9.2).

PMC3391717,S41,4a,Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted to the neurological or neurosurgical units of one of the participating hospitals within 4 days of haemorrhage.
PMC3391717,S42,0,"Investigators based the diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage on the presence of extravasated blood in the basal cisterns by brain CT, orâ€”if CT was negativeâ€”by xanthochromia of cerebrospinal fluid."
PMC3391717,S43,4a,"For patients with a normal CT scan and xanthochromia of cerebrospinal fluid, proof of an aneurysm was a prerequisite for inclusion."
PMC3391717,S44,4a,We included patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage on CT only if they had an aneurysm of the posterior circulation.
PMC3391717,S45,4a,"Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, renal failure (defined as serum creatinine concentration of more than 150 Î_mol/L), bodyweight less than 50 kg, or imminent death."
PMC3391717,S46,0,The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines.
PMC3391717,S47,0,We obtained ethics committee approval from every centre.
PMC3391717,S48,0,All patients provided written and oral informed consent.
PMC3391717,S50,10,The randomisation code was produced by the University Medical Center Utrecht (The Netherlands) pharmacy.
PMC3391717,S51,"8a,8b","The pharmacy used computer-generated randomisation codes in blocks of four, and stratified by centre."
PMC3391717,S52,9,"The pharmacy produced identical, sequentially numbered, randomly assigned boxes of study medication, containing either magnesium sulphate or placebo."
PMC3391717,S53,10,Local investigators assigned the participant to the box with the lowest study number.
PMC3391717,S54,10,The randomisation key was kept by the pharmacy of the University Medical Center Utrecht.
PMC3391717,S55,11a,"Patients, treating physicians, and investigators assessing outcomes and analysing data were masked to the allocation."
PMC3391717,S57,0,"At admission to hospital, investigators recorded sex, age, and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons subarachnoid haemorrhage grade12 for each patient."
PMC3391717,S58,0,"A score of 1â€“3 was deemed a good clinical condition, and a score of 4â€“5 was deemed a poor clinical condition."
PMC3391717,S59,5,"Study medication consisted of vials containing 64 mmol magnesium sulphate or placebo (saline), produced by the pharmacy of the University Medical Center Utrecht and distributed to the participating centres (except for the centre in Chile, which produced its own study medication)."
PMC3391717,S60,0,An intravenous magnesium dosing regimen of 64 mmol per day after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is safe and maintains serum magnesium concentrations at between 1Â·0 and 2Â·0 mmol/L.13
PMC3391717,S61,0,"Furthermore, symptomatic hypermagnesaemia does not occur in patients with normal renal function.14"
PMC3391717,S62,5,"Therefore, participants received a fixed daily dose of 64 mmol magnesium sulphate reconstituted in 0Â·9% saline, or placebo, as soon as possible after providing consent."
PMC3391717,S63,5,"Investigators administered study medication continuously via intravenous infusion and continued for 20 days after haemorrhage onset, or until hospital discharge or death if it occurred sooner."
PMC3391717,S64,5,Investigators checked renal function at least once every 2 days to prevent symptomatic hypermagnesaemia.
PMC3391717,S65,0,Monitoring of magnesium concentration was not mandatory.
PMC3391717,S66,5,"We discouraged, but permitted, investigators to treat hypomagnesaemia at admission with intravenous magnesium sulphate."
PMC3391717,S67,5,"Investigators treated patients according to local protocols, which included oral nimodipine 360 mg/day, bed rest until aneurysm occlusion, and early aneurysm occlusion, and aimed at achievement of normovolaemia."
PMC3391717,S68,6a,"The primary outcome was dependence15 (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or 5) or death, 3 months after haemorrhage."
PMC3391717,S69,6a,"The research nurse and study coordinator collected outcome data centrally, and assessed the Rankin score by semi-structured telephone interview in the patient's own language."

PMC3391717,S81,0,"We did planned sensitivity analyses by assigning patients lost to follow-up to either a good outcome or a poor outcome irrespective of treatment group, and assigning patients with unknown randomisation codes to either the magnesium group or the placebo group."
PMC3391717,S82,12b,"Planned subgroup analyses were done according to age, sex, clinical condition at admission, method of treatment of aneurysm, and whether the centre treated hypomagnesaemia with intravenous magnesium supplementation."
PMC3391717,S83,12a,We compared the distributions of the modified Rankin Scale scores with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.

PMC3420230,S65,10,"A member of the research team confirmed participant eligibility and entered an agreed minimum amount of pre-randomisation registration data on a secure internet based data form about the participant before randomisation, including the results of routine biochemical blood tests."
PMC3420230,S66,10,Randomisation occurred through the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit using a web based database and randomisation system.
PMC3420230,S67,"8a,8b","The random allocation sequence for each comparison was generated by using a specific function (-ralloc-) in Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX) software within the clinical unit using randomly varying block sizes of two, four, and six."
PMC3420230,S68,9,The random allocation sequence was not revealed until all data outcomes had been collected and the statistical analysis plan registered.
PMC3420230,S69,8b,Randomisation was stratified by the gestation at recruitment for the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison and by trial centre for both comparisons.
PMC3420230,S70,8b,Randomisation for both comparisons within the trial was in a 1 to 1 allocation ratio.
PMC3420230,S71,0,Women who were eligible for both were permitted to participate in either or both factorial comparisons.
PMC3420230,S72,10,"Those who participated in the drug comparison before 34 weeksâ€™ gestation were not allowed to join the timed delivery comparison until 34 weeks, so for that group, randomisation to the two treatment comparisons occurred at different times."
PMC3420230,S73,10,Allocation occurred centrally at the clinical unit using a web based database.
PMC3420230,S74,10,"On randomisation, the clinical unitâ€™s internet trial system issued a unique participant identification number and the participant was randomised to one or both trials according to eligibility."
PMC3420230,S75,10,Sequentially numbered containers were sent to the clinical trialâ€™s pharmacist at each centre at the start of the trial and all packs kept in the pharmacy until distribution to the participant.
PMC3420230,S76,10,"After randomisation to the ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo comparison, an online prescription form was generated for printing."
PMC3420230,S77,9,The participant collected the trial drug or placebo from the hospital pharmacy once the local trialâ€™s pharmacist had selected the pack with the appropriate number.
PMC3420230,S78,11a,"The investigator, pharmacist, and trial participant were blind to group allocation."
PMC3420230,S79,10,"For the timing of delivery comparison, the investigator and participant could not be blinded to the treatment group and appropriate arrangements were made for induction or elective delivery or expectant management as allocated."
PMC3420230,S80,5,"Obstetricians were permitted to induce participants in the expectant management group from 40+0 weeksâ€™ gestation, or as clinical needs dictated."
PMC3420230,S81,5,"Other than the trial randomisation, women were managed in accordance with each unitâ€™s guideline for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, with frequency of blood testing and fetal monitoring determined by the local clinicians."
PMC3420230,S82,0,All centres were aware of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistsâ€™ guidelines for management of obstetric cholestasis.8
PMC3420230,S84,0,"After randomisation, a member of the research team saw participants weekly at the time of their routine clinical visit."
PMC3420230,S85,0,"The participant was asked about adherence to treatment, use of other drugs, and adverse events, and completed the visual analogue scale for itching."
PMC3420230,S86,0,Results of routinely collected biochemical tests were recorded.
PMC3420230,S87,0,Participants were seen six weeks after delivery.
PMC3420230,S88,0,"All maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected by review of postnatal case notes, with adjudication where necessary by the trial management group."
PMC3420230,S89,0,Participants were able to withdraw from the trial at either their own request or the discretion of the treating clinician.
PMC3420230,S90,0,"If a participantâ€™s clinical condition deteriorated (for example, worsening of itch, increasing bile acid levels), the clinician could decide to stop the trial drug and give ursodeoxycholic acid, or deliver the woman if indicated, without breaking the treatment code."
PMC3420230,S92,"11b,5","Women in the first comparison were randomised to ursodeoxycholic acid (250 mg dose; Ursofalk, Dr Falk Pharma, Buckinghamshire), or to placebo capsules (Dr Falk Pharma) identical in appearance and taste to the study drug (white, opaque, hard gelatin capsule)."
PMC3420230,S93,5,The placebo contained lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate.
PMC3420230,S94,11b,"All capsules were packaged and labelled to provide blinded treatment packs in the production unit of the pharmacy department, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust."
PMC3420230,S95,0,Supplies were packed in an approved container and tagged with a single panel label.
PMC3420230,S96,9,"The participantâ€™s name, randomisation number, and date of dispensing were added to the label as part of the dispensing process."
PMC3420230,S97,5,All women received two capsules twice a day and if there was no clinical improvement (itching) or biochemical improvement (serum bile acids or alanine transaminase levels) the dose was increased in increments of two capsules per day every 3-14 days up to a maximum of 2 g/day.
PMC3420230,S98,5,"Women in the second comparison were randomised to early term delivery (induction or delivery started between 37+0 and 37+6) or to expectant management (where spontaneous labour was awaited or caesarean delivery undertaken according to normal obstetric guidelines, usually after 39 weeksâ€™ gestation)."
PMC3420230,S99,5,"By consensus, obstetricians could arrange delivery in the latter group from 40+0 weeksâ€™ gestation."
PMC3420230,S101,6b,"Once the decision not to fund the main trial was known, a full statistical analysis plan was prepared with prespecified primary and secondary outcome measures; this was uploaded onto the trials website, with the date of amendment logged."
PMC3420230,S102,0,No data were unblinded before this time.
PMC3420230,S103,6a,"For the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison, the primary outcome was itch in the mother, measured as the arithmetic mean of all post-randomisation measures of worst itch in the previous 24 hours assessed on a visual analogue scale."
PMC3420230,S104,0,"To avoid over-interpretation of our results, we carried out two online surveys (www.surveymonkey.com) before unblinding of the trial to determine what reduction in score on the visual analogue scale would be a clinically meaningful difference among clinicians involved in treating women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and among women who had previously experienced the condition (full questions given in supplementary appendix 1)."
PMC3420230,S105,0,Women and clinicians were informed that the mean baseline itch score on the visual analogue scale was 60 mm (by analysis of blinded data) and were offered a choice of answers.
PMC3420230,S106,6a,"For the timing of delivery comparison, the primary outcome was caesarean section."
PMC3420230,S107,0,"It is widely believed that induction in general increases the rate of caesarean sections, although recent trials of timing of delivery at term have shown no significant effect.12 13"
PMC3420230,S108,6a,Secondary outcome measures for the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison were prespecified as maternal outcomes and perinatal outcomes.
PMC3420230,S109,6a,"Maternal outcomes were average itch in past 24 hours (visual analogue scale); levels of total bile acids, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase; mode of onset of labour; mode of delivery; indication for delivery; and blood loss at delivery."
PMC3420230,S110,6a,"Perinatal outcomes were gestation at delivery, baby outcome, birth weight, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid, arterial cord pH, venous cord pH, Apgar score at five minutes, congenital anomalies, admission to a neonatal unit (including duration), need for ventilation (including duration), convulsions, and jaundice."
PMC3420230,S111,6a,"For the timing of delivery comparison, we chose the same secondary maternal and perinatal outcomes."
PMC3420230,S112,0,"The outcome measures previously specified at the start of this initial phase of the trial were designed to measure the feasibility of the second phaseâ€”namely, recruitment to the two interventions (total recruitment rate per 1000 deliveries per annum and total recruitment rate per eligible women), recruitment rates related to disease severity, acceptability of randomisation among potential participants offered trial entry, adherence with each treatment arm, and completeness of outcome data."
PMC3420230,S114,0,All centres undertook an audit in parallel with the trial from the start of recruitment until 1 April 2010 (when the initial target of 90 women had been recruited).
PMC3420230,S115,0,"They identified all pregnant women with raised bile acid levels (in collaboration with each hospitalâ€™s chemical pathology laboratory) and undertook postnatal case note review to ascertain whether a diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy had been confirmed, what treatment had been given, and whether the participation in the trial had been offered."
PMC3420230,S116,0,The number of deliveries per centre per month during the audit period was obtained.
PMC3420230,S118,7a,"For the planned factorial trial, we estimated that a provisional sample size would be 1498 women (749 per group)."
PMC3420230,S119,7a,"This would give 80% power, Î± 0.05, to show a reduction in the primary composite endpoint (fetal death or severe morbidity) from 6% to 3%."
PMC3420230,S120,7a,"However, detailed power calculations were not possible without an accurate estimate of the event rate and the clinical spectrum of likely recruits to such a trial."
PMC3420230,S121,7a,The target sample size of the initial phase was determined to be about 90 participants to allow reasonably precise estimates of the variables for the main trial.
PMC3420230,S122,7a,"After the decision to analyse the initial phase alone and before unblinding, we undertook a sample size calculation based on our new primary outcome measure of maternal itch score with the clinically meaningful difference as determined."
PMC3420230,S123,7a,This confirmed that the study as carried out had over 99.9% power to detect a difference of 30 mm (with a standard deviation of 26 mm across both arms and a correlation between baseline and follow-up measurements).
PMC3420230,S125,0,"Trial analysis followed the intention to treat principle, with women and infants analysed according to the original randomised allocation, irrespective of adherence and crossovers."
PMC3420230,S126,12a,"For repeated measurements over time (severity of itch and biochemistry), we used the average (arithmetic or geometric mean) during the intervention period.19"
PMC3420230,S127,12a,"In all analyses, regression methods were used and adjustment made for stratification variables (gestation at recruitment for ursodeoxycholic acid trial only, and study centre for both trials) and for potential confounders (baseline bile acid levels, and others where the imbalance was substantial)."
PMC3420230,S128,0,For the analysis of perinatal outcomes we treated all infants (singletons or twins) equally.
PMC3420230,S129,12a,"To allow for multiple pregnancy, we adjusted standard errors for clustering by mother using the Huber-White sandwich estimator, and multiplicity included as a covariate.20"
PMC3420230,S130,12a,Mode of delivery was expressed as a perinatal outcome owing to the inclusion of twin pregnancies in which the mode of delivery may be different for one twin.
PMC3420230,S131,0,For continuous outcomes (such as visual analogue scale measurement and biochemical results) covariates included the baseline measurement.21
PMC3420230,S132,12a,Because of the spread and distribution of values we based the analysis of biochemical markers on logged values.
PMC3420230,S133,12a,The treatment effect was presented as a concentration ratio (the ratio between treatment groups of the geometric mean concentration post-randomisation).
PMC3420230,S134,12a,We estimated risk ratios and risk differences for yes or no outcomes; we used binary regression with a log-link (for risk ratios) and a linear link (for risk differences).
PMC3420230,S135,12a,Time to delivery was treated as partially censored data and analysed using Coxâ€™s proportional hazards.
PMC3420230,S136,0,"For the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison, censoring was at delivery (if after 37 weeks) for pregnancies randomised to the early term delivery arm of the other trial and undergoing induction of labour or caesarean section owing to trial allocation (rather than maternal or fetal compromise or the request of the mother or obstetrician); and otherwise at 40 weeks."
PMC3420230,S137,0,"For the timing of delivery comparison, censoring was at 40 weeks in all cases."
PMC3420230,S138,0,"For subgroup analyses, the principal subgroup was level of bile acids at baseline (continuous and in three categories: normal with raised alanine transaminase levels (bile acids 14 Âµmol/L, alanine transaminase >100 U/L), mild (bile acids 15-40 Âµmol/L), and severe (bile acids >40 Âµmol/L)."
PMC3420230,S139,12b,"We used interaction tests to determine whether apparent differences in treatment effect between groups could be interpreted as real (not due to chance only), and hence to indentify subgroups that might or might not benefit from randomised treatment."
PMC3420230,S140,12a,"Analyses were done in the statistical package Stata version 11.1 or later (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."
PMC3420230,S142,24,The protocol22 was published at the start of the trial.
PMC3420230,S143,0,The updated statistical analysis plan was uploaded onto the trials website before unblinding of the data and incorporated into the revised protocol.
PMC3420230,S144,0,The trial is reported in accordance with the consolidated standards of reporting trials guidelines.
PMC3489506,S33,"3a,4b","This randomised, parallel group, double masked, multicentre, placebo controlled, phase III trial was undertaken at 19 sites in England and Wales."
PMC3489506,S34,0,The trial was independently overseen by an independent data safety monitoring committee and a trial steering committee.
PMC3489506,S36,4a,"Children were eligible to participate if they were aged between 3 years and 15 years 8 months at registration visit, had a neurodevelopmental disorder scoring 1.5 SD or more below the mean on the adaptive behaviour assessment system (ABAS),11 and had a sleep disorder reported by parents for at least the past five months characterised as failing to fall asleep within one hour of â€œlights offâ€ù in three nights out of five or achieving less than six hours of continuous sleep in three nights out of five, or both."
PMC3489506,S37,4a,Children were required to be free from drugs that could cause sleepiness and no have taken no melatonin within the preceding five months.
PMC3489506,S38,0,"At registration, parents/carers were provided with a booklet of advice on previously trialled and standardised sleep behaviour treatment.12"
PMC3489506,S39,0,This was used as a run in to ensure that children who progressed to the randomisation phase did not include those whose sleep disorder could have been amenable to treatment with non-pharmacological intervention.
PMC3489506,S40,4a,"Sleep was monitored during the registration period by using sleep diaries completed by parents, and children were randomised if they continued to fulfil the eligibility criteria with the sleep disorder criteria evident from these sleep diaries."
PMC3489506,S42,5,The childâ€™s age appropriate bedtime was established at the start of the registration period and the trial drug was administered 45 minutes before this time either orally or through a feeding tube if required.
PMC3489506,S43,5,"If the child was tube fed, the capsule was opened and the study treatment suspended in an appropriate medium.12"
PMC3489506,S44,5,"At randomisation, each child was given 0.5 mg."
PMC3489506,S45,5,"At each of four weekly intervals, the childâ€™s sleep pattern, as recorded on the sleep diary, was reviewed and the dose was increased to the next dose increment on the basis that the child fulfilled the sleep disorder eligibility criteria, had received at least five of the possible seven doses in the preceding week, and had not experienced any serious adverse events."
PMC3489506,S46,5,"There was a maximum of three dose increments from 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 6 mg, and a maximum of 12 mg."
PMC3489506,S47,5,Step down in dose was possible if adverse effects were experienced at a higher dose.
PMC3489506,S48,5,"Participants were followed up for 12 weeks from randomisation with a combination of home visits, telephone calls, and clinic attendance."
PMC3489506,S50,"8a,8b,10","The trial statistician generated randomisation lists in Stata (release 9, College Station, TX) in a 1:1 ratio using block randomisation with random variable block lengths of two and four stratified by centre."
PMC3489506,S51,10,The statistician had no further access until determination of the analysis population.
PMC3489506,S52,11b,The placebo capsules and contents were identical in internal and external appearance.
PMC3489506,S53,9,Treatment packs were numbered sequentially and dispensed by the pharmacy of each site.
PMC3489506,S54,9,Treatment packs held enough drugs for the 12 week period and allowed for potential dose escalation.
PMC3489506,S55,11a,All trial staff and participants were blind to treatment allocation throughout the trial.
PMC3489506,S57,3a,"The trial design included both subjective (diary) and objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep, as recommended by Sadeh.13"
PMC3489506,S58,0,"There are benefits with each approach and reasons why the results might not be concordant4 7; for example, sleep diaries would not detect periods when the child was awake but not disturbing the household (a particular concern for determining sleep onset latency), and actigraphy could interpret restless sleep as being awake."
PMC3489506,S59,0,"Between registration and study completion, parents were asked to complete weekly sleep diaries."
PMC3489506,S60,0,"The actigraph (MicroMini-Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring, New York), an accelerometer, is worn on the wrist and movement is monitored continuously and stored within the unit."
PMC3489506,S61,0,Subsequent analysis of frequency and pattern of movement by means of validated algorithms permits detection of basic sleep-wake patterns.13
PMC3489506,S62,5,Children wore the actigraph continuously between registration and randomisation and the 12th week after randomisation.
PMC3489506,S64,6a,"The primary outcome was total sleep time, measured by diaries completed by parents."
PMC3489506,S65,6a,Each night the minutes between the times that the child went to sleep and woke up the next morning were calculated minus any night time awakenings.
PMC3489506,S66,6a,A minimum of five out of seven nightsâ€™ data at baseline (the week before randomisation) and during the final week were required and the weekly average calculated at each time point.
PMC3489506,S67,6a,Secondary sleep outcomes included total sleep time measured by actigraphy; sleep onset latency measured by diaries and actigraphy; and sleep efficiency (the proportion of time spent in bed asleep) measured by actigraphy.
PMC3489506,S68,6a,"Sleep onset latency measured the time taken for a child to go to sleep from â€œsnuggle downâ€ù time recorded on the sleep diary for both sleep diary and actigraphy measures, with onset of sleep determined by the respective methods."
PMC3489506,S69,6a,Four questionnaires were completed at baseline and at the final visit: the composite sleep disturbance index (CSDI; based on allocating scores according to the frequency and duration of sleep problems reported by parents in questionnaires)14 15 16; the aberrant behaviour checklist (ABC) to assess behavioural problems17 18; the family impact module of the paediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) to assess the quality of life of the care giver19; and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) to assess the daytime sleepiness of the care giver.20
PMC3489506,S70,6a,We used a seven point Likert scale to assess parental perception of childâ€™s sleep quality.
PMC3489506,S71,6a,We measured salivary melatonin concentrations for each participant to calculate dim light melatonin onset (DLMO).
PMC3489506,S72,0,Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in a circadian rhythm influenced by light levels.
PMC3489506,S73,0,"Concentrations are usually low during the day, but as evening approaches they start to rise sharply peaking at around midnight."
PMC3489506,S74,0,The beginning of this rise is what is known as the dim light melatonin onset time.
PMC3489506,S75,6a,Salivary samples were collected at two time points on the night before the randomisation clinic visit and at the beginning of the 11th week with two nights of trial treatment omitted.
PMC3489506,S76,6a,Saliva samples were collected hourly from 5 pm until the childâ€™s usual bedtime.
PMC3489506,S77,6a,A minimum of 2 ml of saliva was obtained by asking the child to spit into a tube or by placing a saliva sponge in the buccal cavity of the childâ€™s mouth.
PMC3489506,S78,0,Saliva samples were also taken for DNA analysis to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with the sleep outcomes.
PMC3489506,S79,0,DNA analyses are ongoing.
PMC3489506,S81,6a,A paediatrician physically examined the children at the screening and final visits.
PMC3489506,S82,6a,"The frequency and severity of spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded weekly along with prompted reports of adverse events of interest (treatment emergent signs and symptoms) covering somnolence, increased excitability, mood swings, rash, hypothermia, and cough."
PMC3489506,S83,6a,Weekly seizure diaries recording the type and number of seizures were completed for those children with a pre-existing diagnosis of epilepsy.
PMC3489506,S84,6a,The Investigatorâ€™s Brochure was referred to in the assessment of causality and expectedness.
PMC3489506,S86,6a,"Interactions between treatment and autism, the type of sleep disorder (categorised as delayed sleep onset, poor sleep maintenance, or both), baseline measurements, and childâ€™s age and weight were considered for the primary outcome and sleep onset latency as post hoc analyses."
PMC3489506,S87,6a,Additional analyses assessed whether there was a change in morning wake up time and number and duration of night awakenings to determine whether the observed increase in total sleep time was explained by reduced sleep onset latency.
PMC3489506,S89,12a,"We used the â€œintention to treatâ€ù principle throughout and undertook analyses with SAS (version 9.1.3, Cary, NC)."
PMC3489506,S90,12a,Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals.
PMC3489506,S91,12a,"Continuous outcomes are presented with means and standard deviations at baseline, at study completion (week 12), and for the change from baseline for each group."
PMC3489506,S92,"12a,12b","We used analysis of covariance to adjust results for the dependent variables (total sleep time, sleep onset latency) measured at baseline and in exploratory analyses for treatment covariate interactions."
PMC3489506,S93,0,The trial was originally designed with two primary outcomes: total sleep time according to the sleep diary and sleep onset latency measured with actigraphy.
PMC3489506,S94,6b,During trial recruitment we observed high rates of missing data (66%) for actigraphy so we re-designated sleep onset latency as a secondary outcome and removed the Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment21 in a protocol amendment.
PMC3489506,S95,0,The process adopted in protecting trial validity was that suggested by Evans.22
PMC3489506,S96,7a,Total sleep time was powered at 80% with a 5% significance level to detect a change from baseline of one hour between the melatonin and placebo group with a common standard deviation of 1.7.23 24
PMC3489506,S97,7a,"Allowing for 20% missing data based on observed rates at the time of the amendment, we calculated we needed 57 participants in each group."
PMC3489506,S98,7a,"We reassessed the estimate of the common standard deviation used in the sample size calculation after the first 20 participants as 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.7), and the independent data safety monitoring committee recommended the trial continue without revision of the sample size calculation for the estimated standard deviation used."

PMC3502035,S47,3a,Participants were assigned to the groups using a prespecified ratio of 1:2 for usual care versus intervention (with a further ratio of 1:2 within the intervention arm to assign participants to a monotherapy strategy and to two possible combined treatment strategies).
PMC3502035,S48,0,Quality control of the sites and general practitioners was achieved by visits before randomisation and at study end.

PMC3502035,S55,0,"Eligible participants underwent baseline assessment, including determination of absolute cardiovascular risk.5"
PMC3502035,S56,0,"On the basis of this assessment, we identified target risk factor measures (including blood pressure, lipid levels, exercise levels, smoking status, and body mass index) for each participant according to national guidelines.6"
PMC3502035,S57,0,A computer program developed by Baker IDI enabled clinical profiling in all participants and subsequent management in intervention patients (see appendix I in the supplementary file).
PMC3502035,S58,5,"Eligible participants began a standard 28 day run-in period of treatment with open label, oral valsartan 80 mg daily, with a mandatory blood pressure check 14 days after the start of treatment to determine the need for immediate (rescue) randomisation if systolic blood pressure was â‰¥180 mm Hg or clinically indicated."
PMC3502035,S59,0,We then randomised into the study those who did not achieve their prespecified blood pressure target within this run-in period or were not specifically withdrawn or lost to follow-up (blinded allocation).
PMC3502035,S61,0,Throughout the study we used a standardised protocol based on national guidelines to record blood pressure measurements.6
PMC3502035,S62,6a,"After participants had rested for at least five minutes and while they were seated we obtained three blood pressure measurements separated by one minute intervals using an appropriate sized cuff and a calibrated, semiautomated oscillometric device approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia."
PMC3502035,S63,6a,We defined aberrant measurements as those where the lowest reading was 10 mm Hg or more for systolic blood pressure or 5 mm Hg or more for diastolic blood pressure below the highest of the three seated readings.

PMC3502035,S65,0,"Given the size and nature of the study, it was impractical to obtain independent, blinded blood pressure levels."
PMC3502035,S66,6a,"Nominated study staff at each site (general practitioner or practice nurse) verified the blood pressure measurements by an independent audit of the clinical details in the case records, outputs from the blood pressure monitor, and the computer decision tool."
PMC3502035,S68,6a,"For those assigned to usual care, we asked general practitioners to follow their usual pattern of clinic visits and treatment strategies (no restriction on prescribed drugs) to achieve the individualised blood pressure target and other prevention targets identified during the run-in phase; the only mandatory study visits were at weeks 6 (a typically brief 10-15 minute consultation) and 26 (final comprehensive evaluation)."
PMC3502035,S69,0,We explicitly acknowledged that this was an enhanced form of usual care given that the participants had already been subject to clinical profiling and had an identified blood pressure target and their doctors potentially had knowledge of the intervention (with the inherent problem of contamination).
PMC3502035,S71,6a,"Those allocated to the intervention arm followed an intensive stepped programme of management, with mandatory visits to their doctor at weeks 6, 10, 14, and 18 after randomisation to review their blood pressure and to adjust their treatment if needed according to prespecified algorithms (see appendix II in the supplementary file)."
PMC3502035,S72,0,"Typically, these consultations lasted 10-15 minutes (about 60 minutes in total) in addition to the time taken for clinical profiling at baseline."
PMC3502035,S73,5,"Reflecting contemporary treatment options for the management of hypertension, different drug pathways were mandated (initial monotherapy with valsartan 160 mg or combined with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine, as single combined pills)."
PMC3502035,S74,5,Scheduling of visits and up-titration of drug treatment was guided by the same computer program developed by Baker IDI to facilitate the initial risk profiling and management.
PMC3502035,S75,6a,A final clinic visit for clinical re-evaluation was scheduled at 26 weeks.
PMC3502035,S77,6a,The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants who achieved their individualised blood pressure target according to national guidelines6 during 26 weeks of follow-up (using last recorded blood pressure for intention to treat analyses).
PMC3502035,S78,6a,"These stringent blood pressure targets, which have been rarely examined for feasibility in a controlled trial, are â‰_125/75 mm Hg if a patient has proteinuria, â‰_130/80 mm Hg if end organ damage is present (including any form of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or microalbuminuria), and the classic target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg for those without evidence of the other two criteria."
PMC3502035,S79,6a,Key secondary endpoints included change in mean sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and absolute risk for cardiovascular disease within five years based on the Framingham risk score5 (where applicable).
PMC3502035,S80,6a,"Secondary endpoints also included the type and rate of adverse events potentially attributable to antihypertensive treatment, and serious adverse events including all cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular eventsâ€”for example, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure."
PMC3502035,S81,0,"Several other secondary endpoints will be the subject of future or expanded reports, including changes in quality of life, depression, self care behaviours, and evidence of end organ damage (including electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and newly detected proteinuria)."
PMC3502035,S83,0,We largely met the study targets for overall recruitment and number of participants entering the run-in phase.
PMC3502035,S84,7a,"Based on the combination of a strong potential for interventional contamination, balanced against the need to establish clinically significant differences between the two groups, the study was initially powered to detect a minimum absolute difference of 7% between the groups for the primary endpoint.13"
PMC3502035,S85,7a,"As proportionately more patients achieved blood pressure control during the study run-in and thus the number of randomised participants was reduced, we recalculated that a total randomised cohort of more than 1500 participants would still provide sufficient study power to detect a minimum 8% difference between groups with more than 85% study power (two sided Î± level of 0.05 and adjusting for 2:1 randomisation for study intervention versus usual care).13"

PMC3944682,S38,13a,"Of 889 patients considered, 556 were judged not to require immediate antibiotics and were randomised."
PMC3944682,S39,0,*Numbers based on general practitioner reports
PMC3944682,S40,8b,Each group was randomised further into 12 subgroups according to three factors.
PMC3944682,S41,8b,"These factors were antipyretic regimens (ibuprofen, paracetamol, or both combined), regular antipyretic versus â€œas requiredâ€ù dosing, and steam inhalation advice versus no advice to inhale with steam."
PMC3944682,S42,0,The web figure uses an example group (no prescription) to illustrate this randomisation process.
PMC3944682,S43,3b,"During the trial (from January 2011), a strategy of no antibiotic prescription was added as a randomised comparison, bringing the total number of randomised groups to five (fig 1)."
PMC3944682,S46,0,"We chose a factorial design for the analgesic and steam components to deal with the management of symptoms, and the antibiotic component particularly to deal with antibiotic use and beliefs in antibiotics."
PMC3944682,S47,0,"The factorial design is not only efficient in assessing multiple interventions, but also provides better control of symptomatic advice (regarding analgesia or steam) that could plausibly affect symptom control in the antibiotic groups."
PMC3944682,S48,0,A non-randomised immediate prescription group was chosen to allow all patients to enter the study and provide two important opportunities.
PMC3944682,S49,0,"Firstly, to observe how often immediate antibiotics are thought necessary by clinicians, and secondly, to be able to compare patient outcomes in those prescribed and not prescribed antibiotics."
PMC3944682,S50,3b,"During the study, it became clear from systematic reviews that delayed prescribing might result in higher antibiotic use than no initial prescription.8"
PMC3944682,S51,3b,"We therefore added a no prescription group to facilitate interpretation of the effect of delayed prescription compared with the alternatives strategies, particularly because both the delayed and no prescription groups in the current study had higher antibiotic use than in previous studies."
PMC3944682,S53,"8a,10",A statistician independent of the study team coordinated the randomisation using computer generated random numbers.
PMC3944682,S54,10,"If the doctor thought that immediate antibiotics were definitely required, they prescribed antibiotics, otherwise patients were randomised to one of four methods of delayed antibiotic prescribing."
PMC3944682,S55,10,We assessed evidence of subversion of randomisation by monitoring the order of use of envelopes (there was no evidence of selective envelope use) and the baseline table (which showed that the groups were well balanced).
PMC3944682,S56,0,A key concern in complex pragmatic factorial trials is keeping the logistics simple and avoiding errors at the point of intervention delivery.
PMC3944682,S57,9,"We made it very simple to execute randomisation and delivery because the health professional took the next pack off the shelf that contained pre-randomised advice sheets (that is, there was no requirementâ€”and hence no errorâ€”in finding and using the correct advice sheets)."
PMC3944682,S58,0,"With careful attention to practitioner equipoise, this method of randomisation to different advice strategies has proved successful in previous trials.11 13 14"
PMC3944682,S59,0,There was no evidence of subversion in the current studyâ€”either for selective envelope use or bias in patient characteristics.

PMC3944682,S62,4a,"Patients had to present in a general practice setting with a respiratory tract infection diagnosed by the health professional (acute cold, influenza, sore throat, otitis media, sinusitis, croup, or lower respiratory tract infection)."

PMC3944682,S64,4a,"Patients were excluded if they were asthmatic (unless ibuprofen or aspirin previously provided no problems), had active or previous peptic ulceration, were hypersensitive to analgesics, and were unable to complete outcome measures (for example, they were visually impaired, had psychosis, or were severely depressed)."
PMC3944682,S65,4a,"Exclusion also applied to patients who required hospital admission (for example, for meningitis, severe pneumonia, epiglottitis, or Kawasaki disease), had a known immune deficiency, or were pregnant or breastfeeding."
PMC3944682,S67,6a,The primary outcome was symptom severity measured at the end of each day during days 2-4 of a two week symptom diary (days 2-4 are when symptoms of all respiratory infections are at their worst11 14).
PMC3944682,S68,0,We chose symptom severity as a key outcome because the most recent systematic review documented worse symptom control with delayed prescription.8
PMC3944682,S69,6a,The diary was completed by patients (or children) until symptoms returned to normal.
PMC3944682,S70,6a,"It used previously validated formats11 15 for rating symptoms (0=no problem, 6=as bad as it could be)."
PMC3944682,S71,6a,"Symptoms included feeling generally unwell, sleep disturbance, fever, interference with normal activities, sore throat, cough, short of breath, facial or sinus pain, earache, and runny or blocked nose."
PMC3944682,S72,6a,Symptom resolution was a secondary outcome because duration differs according to the particular respiratory infection.7
PMC3944682,S73,6a,Patients were telephoned (on days 2-3) to check for any problems with diary completion.
PMC3944682,S74,5,"If no diary was received after two weeks, one mailed reminder was sent and then a phone call made as necessary to document key outcomes using a brief questionnaireâ€”which we have shown to be reliable.13"

PMC3944682,S86,7a,"There were two elements to the calculation, firstly for symptom control (the primary outcome), and secondly for antibiotic use."
PMC3944682,S87,7a,We assumed a standard deviation of 1.1 for our primary outcome.11 13 15
PMC3944682,S88,7a,"Assuming that one analgesic group had symptom control that was 0.5 standard deviations better than one of the other groups (that is, a moderate effect size), 228 patients were needed to allow for 12 groups and 80% follow-up, or 504 patients for 0.33 standard deviations."
PMC3944682,S89,7a,"This effect size was equivalent to one in three people rating symptoms as mild rather than moderate, agreed as a modest effect size by the trial steering committee of a Medical Research Council funded trial of prescribing strategies for acute cough11)."
PMC3944682,S90,6a,"For the antibiotic outcome of the antibiotic strategies (a key outcome for this component of the study), we compared the difference in antibiotic use between the delayed strategies and no antibiotic prescription."
PMC3944682,S91,7a,"Seventy two patients per group or 450 in total were needed in the groups with no prescription or delayed prescription, allowing for 20% loss to follow-up."
PMC3944682,S92,7a,"These numbers also assumed 15% use of antibiotics in the no antibiotic group, and 20-35% use in the delayed prescription groups (20%, 25%, 35%, and 35% for recontact, post-date, collection, and patient led, respectively)."
PMC3944682,S93,7a,We estimated that 72 patients per group would provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.5 standard deviations in symptom control between delayed prescription groups and the no prescription group.

PMC4085478,S50,7a,We calculated 160 patients with mesalazine-refractory UC for the screening phase in order to randomize 144 patients.
PMC4085478,S51,7b,A planned interim analysis included the possibility of increasing the sample size if necessary.
PMC4085478,S52,4a,"The main inclusion criteria were as follows: an active disease with the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) of â‰¥5 and a subscore for â€œblood in stoolâ€ù of â‰¥2 at baseline; a history of bloody diarrhea for at least 6 weeks before inclusion despite mesalazine treatment at a dose of â‰¥3â€‰g/day; or a documented intolerance to mesalazine (for details of criteria, see legend of Figure 1)."

PMC4085478,S58,0,"Doses were selected based on the results of the previous studies (18,19,20)."
PMC4085478,S59,5,The study medication was provided in sachets with pellets taken orally four times daily.
PMC4085478,S60,5,"The study medication was produced, packed, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practice and stored at 2â€“8â€‰Â°C."
PMC4085478,S61,0,"Patients were interviewed, examined, and screened for eligibility at the screening visit (V1, for inclusion and exclusion criteria see legend of Figure 1)."
PMC4085478,S62,0,"Patients to be included received detailed study information, gave written informed consent, and were instructed in completing the study diary (comprising SCCAI and other interview parameters)."
PMC4085478,S63,0,Stool samples were taken to exclude for infectious enterocolitis (including Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli 0157:H7).
PMC4085478,S64,6a,"If the patient was still eligible after 1 week of screening (V2=baseline), a safety lab was taken and a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy was performed."
PMC4085478,S65,7b,"At the interim visits 2 and 6 weeks after baseline (V3 and V4), possible disease exacerbation and changes in medication or adverse events (AEs) were assessed."
PMC4085478,S66,6a,"The treatment period ended 12 weeks after baseline at V5 and involved an interview, a physical examination, a sigmoidoscopy, a safety lab, and the SCCAI assessment."
PMC4085478,S67,6a,The maximal duration of the study was 21 weeks per patient: a 1-week screening period plus 12 weeks of treatment period; patients reaching partial or complete remission (SCCAI <5 at end of treatment) underwent an additional 8-week follow-up without study medication (see Appendix Figure A1).
PMC4085478,S68,0,Patients could discontinue the study at any time without reason.
PMC4085478,S69,0,The investigator could withdraw a patient in case of AEs or disease exacerbation or if therapeutic intervention was required.
PMC4085478,S70,7b,"Discontinuation criteria were the development of complications such as pseudomembranous colitis, an SCCAI increase of â‰¥7 over baseline, or fever >39â€‰Â°C. Discontinuation because of disease exacerbation was defined as an AE."

PMC4085478,S79,11a,Both patients and study personnel remained blinded and unaware of the allocation method throughout the study until database closure.
PMC4085478,S80,11a,It was not possible for patients or investigators to guess the next allocated medication in order to avoid selection or allocation biases.
PMC4085478,S81,12a,"To avoid attrition bias, we handled incomplete data in a conservative manner: all patients with premature treatment termination were included in all final analyses with their last available data (last observation carried forward (LOCF)), so that a possible LT-02 treatment effect was rather reduced than increased."
PMC4085478,S82,0,"More placebo patients may have stopped treatment owing to a lack of efficacy or for other reasons; it is unlikely that the results would have improved if treatment had been continued, and carrying forward the last value appeared to be conservative."

PMC4085478,S84,0,Individuals with possible conflict of interest were neither allowed to recruit patients nor were they involved in the conduct or analyses of the study.
PMC4085478,S85,0,There were no changes in the study methods or outcome parameters after study initiation.
PMC4085478,S86,0,All authors had access to the study data and have reviewed and approved this manuscript.
PMC4085478,S88,0,"The disease activity was assessed using the SCCAI (22) that is validated and has been proven to correlate well with other indices comprising invasive methods (23,24,25,26)."
PMC4085478,S89,6a,The primary end point was changes in SCCAI from baseline (V2) to V5.
PMC4085478,S90,0,"The SCCAI assesses stool frequency during the day and at night, defecation urgency, blood in stool, general well-being, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal manifestations."
PMC4085478,S91,0,"The score ranges from 0 to 19 pointsâ€”the lower the score, the lower the disease activity."
PMC4085478,S92,6a,"We assessed the following secondary and a priori defined end points in an exploratory sense: complete remission (<3 mean SCCAI (26) and â€œblood in stoolâ€ù subscore of 0 (see European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) definition of remission (21), LOCF); partial remission (SCCAI <5, LOCF); clinical response (SCCAI decrease â‰¥2 (26); mucosal healing (endoscopic Mayo Score (EMS) â‰_1); achievement of mucosal healing (EMS â‰_1 at V5 and improvement of EMS â‰¥1 from V2 to V5); patients with complete remission; and a â€œbowel frequencyâ€ù subscore of 0."
PMC4085478,S93,6a,All SCCAI-based end points refer to the patient's mean values of 1 week rounded to integer numbers.
PMC4085478,S94,6a,Time to symptom resolution was defined as the first 3 days with â‰_3 stools per day without visible blood (21).
PMC4085478,S95,6a,"The EMS is categorized as follows: 0, inactive; 1, mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, minimal granularity); 2, moderate disease (marked erythema, friability, granularity, absent vascular pattern, bleeding on minimal trauma, no ulcerations); and 3, severe disease (ulceration, spontaneous bleeding)."
PMC4085478,S96,6a,"The histologic index (by Riley) ranges from 1 representing remission to 4 representing severe colitis; a central pathologist, who was blinded to the groups, assessed the score."
PMC4085478,S98,7a,Data from a dose-finding study (19) showed that a relative effect size for the SCCAI of âˆ_0.8 could be expected from the 3.2â€‰g dose group compared with placebo.
PMC4085478,S99,7a,"Under the parametric assumptions of the t-test, 30 patients per group were needed to detect a difference of a relative effect size of 0.8 between placebo and an active group with a power of 85% (Î±=0.025, one sided)."
PMC4085478,S100,7a,"The sample size was increased from 30 to 36 patients per group to accommodate for nonresponse, loss to follow-up, and other deviations from planned study conditions."
PMC4085478,S101,0,"We also included dose groups of 0.8 and 1.6â€‰g LT-02 to allow for dose-finding and dose-response analyses, as the drug LT-02 was new and had not been tested in studies."
PMC4085478,S102,0,Primary analysis was based on the full analysis set (intention to treat) that included all randomized patients.
PMC4085478,S103,12a,"If a patient had a missing value at the final visit (V5), the latest available value was carried forward."
PMC4085478,S104,12a,"Analysis of covariance was used to model the primary end point, including the following baseline covariates: (i) mean SCCAI in the past 7 days of the screening period; and (ii) disease extent."
PMC4085478,S105,12a,The model including these two covariates and the treatment group effect was considered to be the core model.
PMC4085478,S106,0,"It was used to compare the effects of placebo and the individual dose groups in fixed sequence, starting with the highest dose group of 3.2â€‰g LT-02 daily, followed by the lower dose groups in descending order."
PMC4085478,S107,12a,"The confirmatory testing procedure stopped at the first nonsignificant result; superiority was given if the one-sided P value was <0.025, equivalent to a two-sided Î± level of 0.05."
PMC4085478,S108,12a,Survival methods were used to analyze time-to-event variables; the log-rank test compared time with event curves between treatment groups.
PMC4085478,S109,12a,likelihood ratio Ï‡2 tests based on nominal logistic regression were planned to compare the results of qualitative variables between treatment groups.
PMC4085478,S110,12a,"The analysis plan did not specify how the groups should be compared: in order to increase the statistical power, we focused on the comparisons between placebo and the three active groups pooled."
PMC4085478,S111,0,The statistical power to detect treatment effects in categorical parameters in this small sample size is far below the usual 80â€“90%.
PMC4085478,S112,0,"This is why we defined categorical variables such as rate of remission or mucosal healing a priori as secondary and exploratory, in order to discover trends in treatment effects to gather information for the sample-size calculation for future phase III studies."
PMC4085478,S113,12a,Linearity was checked for important continuous variables compared with log transformation.
PMC4085478,S114,12a,Normality for continuous parameters was assumed if the absolute value of skewness was<1.
PMC4085478,S115,12a,"In addition, the Shapiroâ€“Wilk goodness-of-fit tests were applied."
PMC4085478,S116,7b,"A planned interim analysis was conducted by an independent data monitoring committee after half of the patients had terminated the treatment period to adjust the sample size or to stop the trial for futility, if indicated."

PMC4469977,S47,0,"During the feasibility stage, priority of the research question, choice of outcome measures, and methods of recruitment were informed by discussions with patients through a focus group session and two structured interviews."
PMC4469977,S48,0,"During the trial, a patient joined the independent trial steering committee."
PMC4469977,S49,0,Members of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network also identified this research as being a priority area for clinicians treating patients with pyoderma gangrenosum.
PMC4469977,S50,0,"Once the trial has been published, participants will be informed of the results through a dedicated website (www.stopgaptrial.co.uk) and will be sent details of the results in a study newsletter suitable for a non-specialist audience."
PMC4469977,S52,4b,Recruitment took place at 39 hospitals in the United Kingdom.
PMC4469977,S53,4a,"Participants were aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum made by a recruiting dermatologist."
PMC4469977,S54,0,"Histopathology is rarely pathognomonic for pyoderma gangrenosum, and many clinicians avoid biopsy because of the risk of an immunological reaction that results in ulcer extension at the biopsy site."
PMC4469977,S55,0,"If the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, a biopsy was performed to exclude other diagnoses such as malignancy, granulomatous pyoderma gangrenosum, and arteritis, and advice was sought from an expert panel as necessary."
PMC4469977,S56,4a,"We excluded patients with pustular or granulomatous variants of pyoderma gangrenosum (as they may respond differently to treatment, and measurement of a single ulcer was not possible); patients receiving oral prednisolone, ciclosporin, or intravenous immunoglobulin in the previous month; patients participating in another clinical trial; women who were pregnant, lactating, or at risk of pregnancy; patients with known hypersensitivity to either of the study treatments; patients with clinically important renal impairment or other pretreatment findings that would result in the investigator not using either of the study drugs; patients with malignant or premalignant disease; patients with a concurrent medical condition for which treatments might interfere with ongoing treatment or cause harm; and patients taking rosuvastatin or those who had received a live vaccine in the two weeks before randomisation."
PMC4469977,S58,5,Participants received oral prednisolone (brand chosen according to local practice) 0.75 mg/kg/day in a single dose or ciclosporin (Neoral; Novartis) 4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses.
PMC4469977,S59,5,"As this was a pragmatic trial, the dose could be adjusted according to normal practice, to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/day for prednisolone and 5 mg/kg/day for ciclosporin.7 10"
PMC4469977,S60,5,Topical treatment was prohibited during the trial.
PMC4469977,S61,3b,A change to the protocol was made in August 2011 (after 82 participants had been enrolled) as bowel perforation was experienced by a participant receiving prednisolone 110 mg/day.
PMC4469977,S62,3b,As a result we implemented ceiling doses of 75 mg/day for prednisolone and 400 mg/day for ciclosporin.
PMC4469977,S64,"8a,8b,10","Participants were randomised (1:1) to treatment allocation using a web based randomisation system hosted by Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, using a computer generated pseudorandom list, with permuted blocks of randomly varying size between two and six (RALLOC add-on12 for Stata, TX)."
PMC4469977,S65,8b,Randomisation was stratified by target lesion size (<20 cm2; â‰¥20 cm2) and presence or absence of underlying systemic disease.
PMC4469977,S66,11a,It was not possible to blind clinicians and participants to treatment allocation owing to resource limitations and the complexities of different dosing regimens and safety testing of the two drugs.
PMC4469977,S67,11a,"As a result, clinicians and participants were informed of their treatment allocation once data had been irrevocably entered into the randomisation database."
PMC4469977,S68,11a,"Treatment allocation was concealed from the statistician and blinded assessors of the digital images until interventions were all assigned and recruitment, data collection, data cleaning, and blind analysis were complete."
PMC4469977,S69,6a,Assessors blind to the allocated treatment assessed the ulcer size and global treatment response from digital images of the target lesion.
PMC4469977,S70,6a,"If digital images were not available, the assessors used physical measurements of the lesion taken during clinic visits and global response by the treating clinician."
PMC4469977,S72,6a,"Clinic visits took place at baseline, week 2, and week 6 (primary outcome) and when the ulcer had healed (up to a maximum of six months)."
PMC4469977,S73,6a,Patient reported outcomes were collected from daily diaries or postal questionnaires.
PMC4469977,S74,6a,"For participants whose pyoderma gangrenosum had healed, we assessed recurrence and time to recurrence from medical notes."
PMC4469977,S76,6a,A template was photographed alongside the target ulcer to calibrate the image in the image analysis software (see supplementary figure).
PMC4469977,S77,6a,"Two trained assessors mapped the circumference of the lesion using VERG Videometry VEV MD software (Vista Medical, Winnipeg, Canada)."
PMC4469977,S78,6a,Two dermatologists independently reviewed all images to ensure that the lesions were consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum and that the measurements taken by the trained assessors were an accurate representation of the ulcerâ€™s size.
PMC4469977,S81,6a,"The main outcome measure was speed of healing over six weeks, captured for a single target lesion for each patient."
PMC4469977,S82,6a,"If multiple lesions were present, we designated the largest lesion that could be photographed on a single plane as the target lesion."
PMC4469977,S83,6a,"We chose speed of healing for the primary outcome as previous studies have shown it to be a good predictor of healing in patients with leg ulcers,13 14 and because blinded outcome assessment was possible using digital images and independent assessors."
PMC4469977,S84,0,Assessing the primary outcome at six weeks also minimised loss to follow-up and the impact of participants switching to alternative treatments before primary outcome assessment.
PMC4469977,S85,6a,"In cases where digital images were unavailable, or of poor quality, we used physical measurements of the ulcer taken by non-blinded clinicians at baseline and six weeks."
PMC4469977,S87,6a,Time to healingâ€”defined as the time at which sterile dressings were no longer required (reported by patients and confirmed by clinicians at subsequent clinic visits).
PMC4469977,S88,6a,We identified this outcome as the most important of the secondary outcomes.
PMC4469977,S89,6a,Pyoderma gangrenosum specific global treatment responseâ€”to assess treatment response we used a seven point Likert scale ranging from completely clear through to worse (assessed by clinicians and participants and from digital images for blinded assessment).

PMC4469977,S94,6a,The period of follow-up available varied depending on the time at which participants were randomised into the trial.
PMC4469977,S95,6a,"Number of treatment failuresâ€”defined as those who withdrew from their randomised treatment because of treatment intolerance, whose pyoderma gangrenosum worsened, or whose target lesion remained unhealed after six months of follow-up."
PMC4469977,S96,6a,"Adverse reactions to study drugsâ€”adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug."
PMC4469977,S98,0,"This was a superiority trial, with prednisolone as the control intervention."
PMC4469977,S99,7a,"To provide 80% power (5% level of significance) to detect a difference in means of 0.5 standard deviations in the primary outcome of speed of healing over six weeks, the target sample size was 140 participants, assuming a loss to follow-up of 10%."
PMC4469977,S100,7a,"We chose a difference of 0.5 standard deviations as being a clinically meaningful between group difference, as observational data suggested that ciclosporin was potentially more effective, but at higher cost, than prednisolone.19 20 21"
PMC4469977,S101,7a,"As a result, we felt that a substantial treatment effect was necessary to justify a change in clinical practice."
PMC4469977,S103,0,We prespecified all analyses in a statistical analysis plan.
PMC4469977,S104,0,"Analysis was conducted using intention to treat principles; defined as all randomised participants, excluding those with a later diagnosis determined to be something other than pyoderma gangrenosum."
PMC4469977,S105,0,We included all participants with available data at both the baseline and the six week visit in the primary analysis.
PMC4469977,S106,12a,The impact of missing values was explored in sensitivity analysis.
PMC4469977,S107,12a,"A linear regression model was used to analyse differences between treatment groups for the primary outcome at six weeks, adjusting for the stratification variables."
PMC4469977,S108,12a,"Secondary outcomes were analysed using Cox regression models (for time to event outcomes); linear regression models for dermatology life quality index, EQ-5D, and EQ-VAS (adjusted for baseline values), and for self reported pain (which were summarised using area under the curve); proportional odds models for ordered categorical outcomes; and logistic regression models for binary outcomes."
PMC4469977,S109,0,All analyses were adjusted for the stratification variables.
PMC4469977,S110,12b,"Sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome and time to healing were further adjusted for additional baseline variables including age, sex, weight, size of recruiting centre and geographical region; missing data; and participants who switched randomised treatments or received the trial drugs in combination during the period of the trial."

PMC4469977,S112,12a,"All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.2 and R version 2.10.1."
PMC4515982,S40,0,The trial was coordinated by the ALS Centre at the IRCCS Foundation â€˜Carlo Bestaâ€™ of Milan.

PMC3002766,S5,,Ischaemic digital ulcers (DUs) are common in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and are a cause of disease-related morbidity.
PMC3002766,S6,,"In an earlier trial, treatment with bosentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist, reduced the occurrence of new DUs by 48%."
PMC3002766,S7,,"The present study (RAPIDS-2, for â€˜RAndomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled study with bosentan on healing and prevention of Ischemic Digital ulcers in patients with systemic Sclerosisâ€™) was conducted to more fully evaluate the effects of bosentan treatment on DUs associated with SSc."
PMC3002766,S8,,Methods
PMC3002766,S9,,"This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 41 centres in Europe and North America randomised 188 patients with SSc with at least 1 active DU (â€˜cardinal ulcerâ€™) to bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 125 mg twice daily thereafter for 20 weeks (n=98) or matching placebo (n=90; total 24 weeks)."
PMC3002766,S10,,The two primary end points were the number of new DUs and the time to healing of the cardinal ulcer.
PMC3002766,S11,,"Secondary end points included pain, disability and safety."
PMC3002766,S12,,Results
PMC3002766,S13,,"Over 24 weeks, bosentan treatment was associated with a 30% reduction in the number of new DUs compared with placebo (meanÂ±standard error: 1.9Â±0.2 vs 2.7Â±0.3 new ulcers; p=0.04)."
PMC3002766,S14,,This effect was greater in patients who entered the trial with more DUs.
PMC3002766,S15,,There was no difference between treatments in healing rate of the cardinal ulcer or secondary end points of pain and disability.
PMC3002766,S16,,Peripheral oedema and elevated aminotransferases were associated with bosentan treatment.
PMC3002766,S17,,Conclusions
PMC3002766,S18,,Bosentan treatment reduced the occurrence of new DUs in patients with SSc but had no effect on DU healing.
PMC3002766,S19,,Bosentan was well tolerated and may be a useful adjunct in the management of patients with SSc with recurrent DUs.
PMC3002766,S20,,Introduction
PMC3002766,S21,,"Intimal hyperplasia, endothelial dysfunction and occlusive vasculopathy are ubiquitous features of systemic sclerosis (SSc)."
PMC3002766,S22,,"These vascular lesions are the underlying basis of important clinical syndromes in SSc, including scleroderma renal crisis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and Raynaud's phenomenon.1"
PMC3002766,S23,,"Patients with SSc are at high risk for the development of ischaemic digital ulcers (DUs), which occur in 35% to 60% of patients with SSc2â€“5 and are an important source of morbidity."
PMC3002766,S24,,"Among a cohort of 2080 patients with SSc identified between 1972 and 1995 and prospectively followed-up for a mean of 10 years, 58% of patients had a history of DUs.5"
PMC3002766,S25,,"Of all patients with SSc, 32% (666 patients) had persistent or recurrent DUs for â‰¥6 months; of these, 30% (197 patients) had severe DUs (complicated by gangrene, or requiring digital sympathectomy or amputation)."
PMC3002766,S26,,"In one series, the incidence of finger amputation as a consequence of DUs was 1.2% per patient-year.6"
PMC3002766,S27,,"The pathogenesis of DUs is thought to include many of the hallmark processes of critical tissue ischaemia, such as impaired afferent vasomotion, microvascular disruption, reduced venous drainage, increased local platelet activation and increased leucocyte adherence.1"
PMC3002766,S28,,"As a result, no single pharmacological treatment is entirely effective."
PMC3002766,S29,,"Nifedipine and intravenous iloprost reduced the frequency and severity of SSc-related Raynaud's phenomenon attacks,7 and iloprost was shown to improve DU healing in another trial that included patients with active DUs.8"
PMC3002766,S30,,Few studies have been specifically designed to examine efficacy in the prevention or treatment of DUs.
PMC3002766,S31,,Nifedipine and intravenous iloprost resulted in the reduction from baseline in the mean number of DUs in a small study.7
PMC3002766,S32,,"Similarly, a trial in patients with severe PAH associated with SSc9 indicated there may be a beneficial effect of epoprostenol on the number of DUs."
PMC3002766,S33,,"In a recent small placebo-controlled study, atorvastatin reduced the number of new DUs in association with improvement in markers of endothelial function.10"
PMC3002766,S34,,Indirect evidence implicates endothelin (ET) as a potential mediator of the vascular dysfunction in SSc.
PMC3002766,S35,,"Plasma ET concentrations are increased in patients with SSc, and there is evidence for increased ETB receptor expression in lung, skin and blood vessels in this disease.11"
PMC3002766,S36,,Other actions of ET relevant to SSc include proinflammatory and proliferative effects as well as mediation of vasoconstriction.12
PMC3002766,S37,,ET receptor antagonists including bosentan are now commonly used for the treatment of PAH in SSc.13â€“15
PMC3002766,S38,,"A previous double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigated the role of bosentan in the reduction of new DUs in 122 patients with SSc and a history of DUs within the previous year.16"
PMC3002766,S39,,"After 16 weeks of treatment, patients receiving bosentan had a 48% reduction in the mean number of new DUs compared with placebo (1.4 vs 2.7 new ulcers; p=0.01), but there were no differences between treatments in end points assessing DU healing in the 63% of patients with active DUs at baseline."
PMC3002766,S40,,"The present study (RAPIDS-2, for â€˜RAndomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled study with bosentan on healing and prevention of Ischemic Digital ulcers in patients with systemic Sclerosisâ€™) was designed to further investigate the effects of bosentan as a treatment for DUs secondary to SSc over a 24-week treatment period in a larger population of patients, all of whom had active DUs at study entry."
PMC3002766,S41,,The primary objectives were to evaluate the effect of bosentan on the reduction of new DUs and healing of DUs in patients with SSc.
PMC3002766,S42,,"Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of bosentan on pain and disability, as well as its tolerability and safety in these patients."

PMC3002766,S102,,New DUs
PMC3002766,S103,,"The proportion of patients with no new DUs up to week 24 was similar with bosentan and placebo (observed in 32/95 (33.7%) and 26/89 (29.2%) patients, respectively, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.77); p=0.53)."
PMC3002766,S104,,"The proportion of patients with one or more new DU was 66.3% (63/95) on bosentan compared with 70.8% (63/89) on placebo; the difference in observed proportions between treatments was greater in patients with multiple new DUs (18.9% vs 29.2% with â‰¥4, 10.5% vs 29.8% with â‰¥5, etc; figure 4)."
PMC3002766,S105,,The maximum number of new DUs per patient was 10 on bosentan and 16 on placebo.
PMC3002766,S106,,"Time-to-event analyses up to week 24 indicated an increasing reduction in risk with bosentan compared with placebo for the appearance of each successive new DU, with a HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.95, p=0.03) for the fifth new DU."

PMC3002766,S112,,"No treatment effects were observed in the times to healing up to week 24 for all baseline DUs (HR 0.94 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.37), p=0.74) or of all new DUs (HR 1.40 (0.78 to 2.51), p=0.26)."
PMC3002766,S113,,"Healing of all DUs (baseline and new combined) at week 24 was observed in 35/95 (36.8%) and 35/89 (39.3%) of patients on bosentan and placebo, respectively (RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.35), p=0.76)."
PMC3002766,S114,,Pain and disability
PMC3002766,S115,,"Patient-rated measures of overall hand pain and pain of the cardinal ulcer, as assessed by visual analogue scales, showed no differential treatment effect in pain at week 24 (mean treatment effects of âˆ’1.7 (95% CI âˆ’11.4 to 7.9), p=0.73 and âˆ’1.6 (âˆ’11.5 to 8.3), p=0.75, respectively)."
PMC3002766,S116,,"The changes from baseline in the HAQ disability index and hand disability index at week 24 were also similar in both treatment groups (âˆ’0.04 (95% CI âˆ’0.15 to 0.08), p=0.51 and âˆ’0.04 (âˆ’0.20 to 0.12), p=0.62, respectively)."
PMC3002766,S117,,Post hoc analyses of new DUs
PMC3002766,S118,,"In unplanned post hoc analyses in subgroups defined by the number of DUs at baseline, the mean treatment effect with bosentan was âˆ’2.1 (95% CI âˆ’3.8 to âˆ’0.4) new DUs (p=0.02) in patients with at least four DUs at baseline and âˆ’0.3 (âˆ’1.1 to 0.4) new DUs (p=0.39) in patients with less than four DUs at baseline (table 2)."
PMC3002766,S119,,"In both subgroups, the estimated proportion of patients without each subsequent new DU was larger in the bosentan than placebo group except the first new DU (table 3), and the difference between treatment groups was larger among patients with at least four new DUs than in those with fewer than four new DUs."
PMC3002766,S120,,"No difference between treatments was observed in the mean total number of DUs (baseline plus new) per patient among patients with at least four DUs at baseline (âˆ’3.4 (95% CI âˆ’4.8 to âˆ’1.9) on bosentan and âˆ’3.6 (âˆ’5.4 to âˆ’1.7) DUs on placebo) and those with fewer than four DUs at baseline (âˆ’0.6 (âˆ’1.0 to âˆ’0.2) and âˆ’0.5 (âˆ’1.1 to 0.1) DUs, respectively)."

PMC3002766,S123,,Safety and tolerability
PMC3002766,S124,,"Serious adverse events occurred in 9.4% and 16.7% of patients on bosentan and placebo, respectively (table 4), with only one serious event (pneumonia) reported for more than one patient on bosentan."
PMC3002766,S125,,One patient on placebo died from acute respiratory distress syndrome during the post-treatment follow-up.
PMC3002766,S126,,The proportions of patients experiencing at least one adverse event were similar in both treatment groups (table 4).
PMC3002766,S127,,Adverse events occurring in more patients on bosentan than placebo included peripheral oedema (18.8% vs 4.4%) and events denoting elevated aminotransferases (12.5% vs 2.2%).
PMC3002766,S128,,"These adverse events resulted in premature discontinuation of bosentan treatment in 2.1% and 5.2% of patients, respectively (vs none on placebo)."
PMC3002766,S129,,"Overall, adverse events led to the discontinuation of study treatment in 15.6% of patients on bosentan and 12.2% on placebo."
PMC3002766,S130,,Laboratory tests identified increased aminotransferases to >3Ã—ULN in 10/95 (10.5%) patients on bosentan (which included one patient with an elevation to >8Ã—ULN) and 1/88 (1.1%) patients on placebo.
PMC3002766,S131,,"In all cases on bosentan, elevated aminotransferases resolved during continued treatment, after a decrease in dose, or following temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation."

PMC3002766,S133,,Discussion
PMC3002766,S134,,"In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, bosentan treatment was associated with a 30% reduction in the number of new DUs over the 24-week treatment period but did not result in a treatment effect on healing of the cardinal ulcer."
PMC3002766,S135,,"The reduction of new DUs was more pronounced among patients with multiple DUs; large numbers of new DUs were less likely to occur, and the appearance of each successive new DU was delayed in patients on bosentan compared with those on placebo."
PMC3002766,S136,,"Based on post hoc analyses, the reduction of new DUs appeared to be greater in patients with at least four DUs at baseline."
PMC3002766,S137,,"The mean total number of DUs per patient at week 24 was similar in the two treatment groups, and no treatment effects were observed in the other measures of healing or patient-rated measures of pain and disability used."
PMC3002766,S138,,This is the second randomised placebo-controlled trial to show a reduction in the number of new DUs in susceptible patients with SSc treated with bosentan.
PMC3002766,S139,,"Consistent with the first trial, the observed treatment effect was greater in patients with multiple DUs, while there was no effect on healing parameters.16"
PMC3002766,S140,,"The reduction of new DUs without effect on healing in bosentan-treated patients did not translate into a smaller ulcer burden, as was seen in the previous study.16"
PMC3002766,S141,,"In this study, similar reductions in the overall number of DUs (present at baseline and/or new) occurred in both groups."
PMC3002766,S142,,The difference between studies could not be explained by a seasonal effect on the appearance of new DUs due to the different enrolment periods (Octoberâ€“September vs Octoberâ€“February in the first study).
PMC3002766,S143,,"Raynaud's phenomenon is thought to be more severe and new DUs more frequent during the autumn and winter, but the numbers of new DUs in autumn/winter and spring/summer randomisation subgroups were nearly identical."
PMC3002766,S144,,"The patient populations for the two studies appeared similar except that in the earlier study, 38% of patients had no active DU at baseline.16"
PMC3002766,S145,,"Patients in the earlier study had fewer DUs to heal, perhaps giving more weight to prevention in the reduction of overall ulcer burden."
PMC3002766,S146,,The reduction of new DUs with bosentan also did not translate into measurable decreases in pain or disability compared with placebo.
PMC3002766,S147,,"Explanations could include (1) the expected result, given no differences in total number of DUs between treatment groups, (2) a lack of sensitivity to change and discriminative value in the current instruments used to assess hand function in SSc and (3) bosentan treatment does not improve pain and disability in spite of the reduction of new DUs."
PMC3002766,S148,,Improvement in hand function was seen in the previous study.16
PMC3002766,S149,,"A clear picture of the overall benefits of treatment on patient well-being remains elusive, as remaining DUs and the underlying healing rate may confound overall assessments."
PMC3002766,S150,,"In this study, both groups had an equal opportunity for benefit so it may be inferred that in the future, a long-term study on prevention of new ulcers must examine if patient benefit would result, as opposed to the design adopted in the present study."
PMC3002766,S151,,The increased incidence of elevated aminotransferases with bosentan in this and other studies reinforces the need for continual monitoring of liver function with this treatment.
PMC3002766,S152,,"The incidence, severity and resolution of these abnormalities in this study were similar to previous reports.13"
PMC3002766,S153,,The increased incidence of peripheral oedema with bosentan was not previously reported in patients with DUs16 but has been seen in other patient populations.20
PMC3002766,S154,,"This was a large and complex controlled trial, but there are limitations to the data interpretation."
PMC3002766,S155,,The definition of an active DU used in this trial may not match criteria used in other centres.
PMC3002766,S156,,The clinical utility of this promising approach to treatment may be challenged.
PMC3002766,S157,,"In a patient encountered with a single DU, initiation of bosentan would not be expected to facilitate healing, and at least 66% of all bosentan-treated subjects would develop at least one additional DU over 6 months of follow-up."
PMC3002766,S158,,"However, in those patients presenting with multiple DUs (at least four), the effect of bosentan treatment on the reduction of new DUs offers greater potential benefit."
PMC3002766,S159,,"Major outcomes including hospitalisations for infection or need for surgical amputation occur too infrequently to serve as outcome measures in trials of this sort, but it seems reasonable to surmise that reduced occurrence of DUs would ultimately reduce the risk of same in an appropriate population."
PMC3002766,S160,,"In conclusion, two randomised trials have shown that bosentan treatment reduces the occurrence of new DUs compared with placebo in patients with SSc but has no effect on DU healing."
PMC3002766,S161,,Bosentan was well tolerated and may be a useful adjunct in the management of patients with SSc and recurrent DUs.

PMC3002834,S29,,Introduction
PMC3002834,S30,,"Patients with the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)â€”ie, chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), often accompanied by anaemiaâ€”have high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1"
PMC3002834,S31,,Endothelial dysfunction and impaired endothelial regenerative capacity play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosic cardiovascular disease (CVD).
PMC3002834,S32,,Bone marrow (BM) derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) constitute an endogenous vascular repair system that may protect against atherosclerosis development.2
PMC3002834,S33,,Reduced EPC availability or function may contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD.
PMC3002834,S34,,"Disease conditions with high cardiovascular risk, including end-stage renal disease, have been associated with reduced EPC levels and function.3"
PMC3002834,S35,,Others have not observed such inverse relations or even reported a positive relation between EPC number and vascular risk factors.4
PMC3002834,S36,,"In CHF, a negative correlation between cultured EPC and functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class has been reported.5"
PMC3002834,S37,,"However, others have found higher levels of EPC in mild CHF with increased levels of EPC mobilising factors, whereas EPC in severe disease were decreased, despite similar increases in stromal cell-derived factor-1Î± (SDF-1Î±) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).6 7"
PMC3002834,S38,,"This suggests a protective compensatory response to the vascular risk burden in mild CHF, but exhaustion or suppression of BM progenitor cells in advanced CHF."
PMC3002834,S39,,"We hypothesised that in CRS, the combined presence of even mild stages of CHF, CKD and anaemia is associated with impaired levels of circulating EPC, due to accumulation of uremic toxins, decreased nitric oxide availability and increased inflammation."
PMC3002834,S40,,Enhancing circulating EPC may enhance vascular protection and reduce the progression of CVD.
PMC3002834,S41,,"Beneficial effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on the cardiovascular system have been suggested from animal experiments8 and small clinical studies in patients with CKD9 or CHF,10 although these could not be confirmed in larger randomised trials.11"
PMC3002834,S42,,"In patients with myocardial infarction, circulating CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) increased after single high-dose EPO injection.8"
PMC3002834,S43,,Regular dose EPO treatment increased EPC levels in advanced CKD12 and improved EPC function in CHF patients in the longer term.13
PMC3002834,S44,,No randomised controlled studies are available on EPC and regular EPO dose effects in patients with CRS.
PMC3002834,S45,,"We hypothesised that EPO treatment can improve EPC levels in CRS patients, which may be related to a reduction in cardiovascular risk."
PMC3002834,S46,,"We assessed circulating EPC levels and EPC outgrowth number and function in CRS patients compared to healthy controls, and evaluated whether short-term (18 days) and long-term (52 weeks) EPO therapy improved EPC number and function in patients with CRS."

PMC3002834,S147,,Discussion
PMC3002834,S148,,"The present data show that patients with CRS and anaemia who receive standard medication have reduced levels of circulating CD34+KDR+-EPC, despite increased levels of progenitor cell mobilising factor SDF-1Î±."
PMC3002834,S149,,"We observed no effect of short-term, 18â€…days EPO therapy on EPC levels."
PMC3002834,S150,,"In cardiorenal patients not treated with EPO, we observed a marked reduction in CD34+KDR+-EPC levels after one year compared to baseline."
PMC3002834,S151,,"Long-term, 52â€…weeks EPO therapy did not significantly affect this reduction in CD34+KDR+-EPC levels."
PMC3002834,S152,,Our study is the first to report reduced circulating progenitor cells in patients with CRS.
PMC3002834,S153,,Studies on circulating EPC in patients with CHF report variable results.6 7 21 22
PMC3002834,S154,,"We observed that in the presence of CHF, CKD and anaemia, CD34+KDR+-cell levels were decreased independent of cardiac disease severity, as assessed by ejection fraction or NT-proBNP levels."
PMC3002834,S155,,"Plasma levels of NT-proBNP may be influenced by renal dysfunction, but remain a powerful reflection of cardiac status.23"
PMC3002834,S156,,At tissue level EPC recruitment depends on ischaemia or endothelial injury induced up-regulation of SDF-1Î±.
PMC3002834,S157,,"In our study, SDF-1Î± levels correlated with renal function, heart function and endothelial dysfunction markers, indicating that signals for progenitor cell mobilisation are intact."
PMC3002834,S158,,"However, this did not result in an efficient EPC increase in CRS."
PMC3002834,S159,,This may be explained by impaired EPC production due to uraemia and other cardiovascular risk factors and/or increased homing to injured endothelium.
PMC3002834,S160,,"In agreement with previous results,7 in CRS patients with mild CHF, increased SDF-1Î± levels were associated with higher CD34+KDR+-EPC levels, suggesting that in milder CHF stages SDF-1Î± can lead to EPC mobilisation."
PMC3002834,S161,,"In contrast, in severe CHF the association between SDF-1Î± and EPC levels disappeared or even reversed, suggesting an impaired EPC mobilising response to SDF-1Î± in this stage."
PMC3002834,S162,,This is consistent with the biphasic response reported in severe CHF6 7 and may relate to exhaustion of haematopoietic progenitors at the BM level or inflammatory factors exerting BM suppression in advanced CHF.7
PMC3002834,S163,,"Indeed, our data show a significant inverse relation between IL-6 levels and CD34+-HSC numbers."
PMC3002834,S164,,Inflammatory cytokines are known to exert a suppressive effect on erythropoiesis.
PMC3002834,S165,,"Consistently, in our patients with mild anaemia we observed lower Hb levels when hsCRP levels were higher."
PMC3002834,S166,,We observed no correlations between serum EPO levels and either Hb levels or endothelial progenitor cell counts.
PMC3002834,S167,,"Interestingly, CD34+KDR+-EPC levels correlated positively with Hb levels, suggesting a common BM suppressive effect on both EPC production or mobilisation and erythropoiesis."
PMC3002834,S168,,In our study short-term EPO administration did not influence HSC or EPC levels.
PMC3002834,S169,,This contrasts with previous reports in CKD or post-myocardial infarction patients.8 12
PMC3002834,S170,,"In part this discrepancy may be explained by differences in EPO dosage, as EPC response to EPO has been shown to be dose-dependent.24"
PMC3002834,S171,,"Since the potential clinical problems caused by long-term EPO are presumably dose-related,25 our patients received a relatively low, currently recommended, EPO dosage (50â€…IU/kg/week)."
PMC3002834,S172,,This was sufficient to enhance reticulocyte levels.
PMC3002834,S173,,It could be that our CRS patients were not able to increase EPC levels in response to EPO due to exhaustion or suppression of these progenitors at the BM level.7 26
PMC3002834,S174,,"In line with this hyporesponsiveness of EPC on EPO, we observed no relations between serum EPO and EPC levels, whereas endogenous EPO levels were reported to be positively associated with EPC levels in CHF27 or CKD.28"
PMC3002834,S175,,"To our knowledge, no previous randomised trials have reported on one-year follow-up of EPC or HSC levels in a high CVD risk population."
PMC3002834,S176,,"In patients not treated with EPO, we observed a 68% reduction in CD34+KDR+-EPC levels after one year compared to baseline, whereas HSC levels remained unchanged compared to baseline."
PMC3002834,S177,,"This discrepancy may be related to the fact that CRS is associated with impaired NO availability, and that NO and the NO producing enzyme eNOS are essential for EPC mobilisation.29"
PMC3002834,S178,,Our finding that EPC reduced over time whereas HSC were not affected seems consistent with the observation that NO supported mobilisation of EPC but not of HSC in a mouse model.30
PMC3002834,S179,,Long-term EPO treatment showed a minor and non-significant effect on preserving EPC levels over one year.
PMC3002834,S180,,One previous study reported no difference in EPC levels between EPO and non-EPO treated CHF patients after 2.5â€…years follow-up.
PMC3002834,S181,,"However, this observation may be confounded by the cross-sectional study design and retrospective matching of the control group.13"
PMC3002834,S182,,"In contrast to circulating CD34+KDR+-EPC, EPC outgrowth and function were not different between CRS patients and controls."
PMC3002834,S183,,It could be that CRS affects mainly the â€˜trueâ€™ progenitor cells in the haematopoietic/endothelial lineage as it affects progenitors in the erythropoietic lineage in BM.
PMC3002834,S184,,CD34+KDR+-EPC represent a defined subset of true BM-derived progenitor cells with the ability for clonal expansion into endothelial cell colonies from single cells.31
PMC3002834,S185,,"Cultured EPC are mostly derived from CD34-negative cells, and can adopt an endothelial phenotype after culture, but are not able to clonally expand."
PMC3002834,S186,,Earlier studies reported decreased EPC outgrowth and colony forming units in CHF5 7 26 or CKD.32
PMC3002834,S187,,"Besides study population differences, differences in culture method may contribute to the observed discordances.5 7 13 32"
PMC3002834,S188,,"However, our methodology is the same as in previous studies in which we found reduced CD34+KDR+-EPC and EPC outgrowth in patients with CKD20 and ESRD,3 and comparable to methods used in articles reporting reduced cultured EPC in CHF26 and CKD.33"
PMC3002834,S189,,"In conclusion, CRS patients showed reduced CD34+KDR+-EPC levels, consistent with a reduced vascular regenerative potential and despite increased SDF-1Î± levels."
PMC3002834,S190,,Over a one-year follow-up period a marked 68% further reduction in EPC levels was observed in the patient group without EPO treatment.
PMC3002834,S191,,"In spite of promising experimental studies, our longitudinal, randomised study did not show significant influence of either short- or long-term EPO therapy on reduced EPC levels in CRS patients."

PMC3016167,S26,,Introduction
PMC3016167,S27,,"Scorpion sting can pose a life threatening acute medical emergency and is a neglected public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries, especially in North Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and India."
PMC3016167,S28,,"Mesobuthus tamulus, an Indian red scorpion, is the most lethal species of the Buthidae family in India.1"
PMC3016167,S29,,"Its venom delays the closing of neuronal sodium channels, resulting in â€œautonomic stormâ€ù owing to sudden pouring of endogenous catecholamine into the circulation."
PMC3016167,S30,,Autonomic storm is characterised by transient parasympathetic and prolonged sympathetic stimulation.2 3 4 5
PMC3016167,S31,,Similar cardiovascular manifestations are reported in different species of scorpions.6
PMC3016167,S32,,"Morbidity and mortality due to scorpion sting result from acute refractory pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, and multiorgan failure.5"
PMC3016167,S33,,Opinions differ about the correct treatment for scorpion sting.
PMC3016167,S34,,"In the past various regimens, including a lytic cocktail,7 insulin,8 atropine, Î_ blocker, nifedipine,9 and captopril10 have failed to reduce morbidity and mortality, but since the advent of the Î±1 blocker prazosin the fatality rate has been reduced to 1%.11 12"
PMC3016167,S35,,"Scorpion antivenom is a specific antidote capable of neutralising circulating venom toxins if administered soon after sting; it is widely used and believed to be effective by experienced doctors in Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Tunisia, and Iran.13 14 15 16 17"
PMC3016167,S36,,Serotherapy has been a matter of debate and controversy during the past decade.18 19 20 21
PMC3016167,S37,,Whether the antivenom can reverse the cardiac pathophysiological effects of scorpion venom is uncertain.
PMC3016167,S38,,"Several studies have shown that antivenom does not alleviate haemodynamic changes or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, or prevent death19 22 and the outcome was the same for victims treated with antivenom and those treated without antivenom.9 18"
PMC3016167,S39,,"De Rezende and colleagues found that although venom antigen in plasma from people who had been stung by a scorpion was not detected one hour after antivenom therapy, and pain and agitation disappeared within a few hours, patients with pulmonary oedema recovered only 48 hours after serotherapy.23"
PMC3016167,S40,,"Since 2002, monospecific F(ab)2 antivenom serum prepared by immunising horses has been available for clinical use from Haffkine Biopharma Mumbai."

PMC3016167,S118,,We screened 116 patients admitted with scorpion sting for eligibility.
PMC3016167,S119,,"Of 72 eligible patients, 70 were enrolled in the study; 35 were randomly allocated to prazosin alone and 35 to prazosin plus antivenom."
PMC3016167,S120,,All patients completed treatment in the group of allocation and none was lost to follow-up.
PMC3016167,S121,,We analysed end points according to group of allocation.
PMC3016167,S122,,Patients were recruited between March 2009 and February 2010 (table 1).

PMC3016167,S126,,The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline (table 2).
PMC3016167,S127,,Mean time between scorpion sting and arrival at hospital and presenting symptoms were also similar between the groups.

PMC3016167,S129,,Table 3 shows recovery time for clinical signs and symptoms in the two groups.
PMC3016167,S130,,The treating doctors actually sat by the side of patients and noted the duration of profuse sweating and flowing of saliva from the corners of the mouth.
PMC3016167,S131,,They repeatedly felt the palm and sole for temperature.
PMC3016167,S132,,Priapism was noted every 15 minutes.

PMC3016167,S144,,The pattern of improvement was similar in both groups (P=0.838); the difference between groups was non-significant (P=0.982).
PMC3016167,S145,,Patients with hypotension recovered after treatment with intravenous crystalloid solution.
PMC3016167,S146,,"Severity of scorpion sting depends on the dose of venom, size of scorpion, season, age of victim, and time between sting and hospital admission."
PMC3016167,S147,,Nine participants (six children and three adults) deteriorated to grade 3 (five from the prazosin group and three from prazosin plus antivenom group) or grade 4 (one from the prazosin plus antivenom group).
PMC3016167,S148,,"They all reported more than 130 minutes between sting and admission and had mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 159 mm Hg and 105 mm Hg, respectively."
PMC3016167,S149,,Three of these patients had a heart rate of <60 beats per minute and six had a rate of >110 beats per minute.
PMC3016167,S150,,All nine patients had repeated projectile vomiting and vomited their initial dose of oral prazosin (injectable prazosin is not available in India) so that their repeated first dose was received 60 minutes late.

PMC3016167,S157,,She reported to the hospital at 3 am.
PMC3016167,S158,,"On arrival her blood pressure was 140/104 and heart rate 128; she had grade 3/6 systolic murmur, cold extremities, sweating, and absent salivation."
PMC3016167,S159,,"Total white cell count was 23,thin.000 and creatine kinase-MB was 62."
PMC3016167,S160,,She was given 30 mL antivenom and 500 Âµg prazosin.
PMC3016167,S161,,She developed marked tachycardia (heart rate 170 beats per minute) and warm extremities with blood pressure 95/70 mm Hg and pulmonary oedema (grade 4).
PMC3016167,S162,,"She was given nasal oxygen, dobutamine 15 Âµg /kg/minute was raised to 20 Âµg, and oxygen saturation was maintained by non-invasive ventilator for 24 hours in intensive care."
PMC3016167,S163,,Discussion
PMC3016167,S164,,"We found that in patients treated for scorpion sting with scorpion antivenom and prazosin incidences of improvement and deterioration were similar to those in patients treated with prazosin alone, and the addition of antivenom hastened recovery."
PMC3016167,S165,,Previous studies
PMC3016167,S166,,Stimulation of Î± receptors has an important role in the pathogenesis of venomous scorpion sting.6 13
PMC3016167,S167,,"In experimental studies, the major physiological abnormality is stimulation of peripheral Î±1 adrenergic receptors by venom leading to blood pressure response."
PMC3016167,S168,,"For this reason prazosin, an Î± receptor blocker, has been successfully used to reverse toxicity and improve survival.3 11 12"
PMC3016167,S169,,"By blocking Î±1 receptors, prazosin reduces preload and left ventricular impendence without raising heart rate.9"
PMC3016167,S170,,Prazosin is a simple pharmacological and physiological antidote to venom actions that is easily available in rural settings9 making it the standard first line management.11 12
PMC3016167,S171,,"Of 619 patients with severe envenomation by Mesobuthus tamulus admitted at Mahad, hypertension was noted in 55%, pulmonary oedema in 27%, tachycardia with hypotension in 18%; all recovered with oral prazosin.25"
PMC3016167,S172,,"Similar beneficial effects of prazosin have been reported from other states of India,7 26 Saudi Arabia,12 and Turkey.27 29"
PMC3016167,S173,,"Impressive reductions in mortality from Mesobuthus tamulus sting have also been observed with the use of prazosin; from 26% in 1961 to 6% in 1980, and less than 1% at present.11"
PMC3016167,S174,,"In regions where venomous scorpion sting is endemic, prazosin is a â€œdarlingâ€ù among the drugs kept ready in the outpatient department emergency tray; consultants in these areas even carry two tablets in their bags.38"
PMC3016167,S175,,Several specific scorpion antivenoms are available but their efficacy is uncertain.18 19
PMC3016167,S176,,Ancillary treatment with vasodilators is crucial in severely envenomed patients.5 39
PMC3016167,S177,,"Scorpion antivenom has been available for clinical use in India since 2002, but it is always in short supply and not easily available in pharmacies, whereas prazosin is freely available.33 40"
PMC3016167,S178,,Our experience of severe scorpion sting cases since 1977 shows that mortality can be dramatically reduced even in the absence of antivenom.11 12 20 26 29
PMC3016167,S179,,Although the regimen including scorpion antivenom hastens recovery it is not mandatory.39 40
PMC3016167,S180,,"Species specific antivenom is needed to neutralise the circulating venom; however, prazosin, by antagonising sympathetic overactivity and correcting deranged metabolism, is effective against envenomation by different scorpion species.7 12 16 17 19"
PMC3016167,S181,,In severe scorpion envenomation the dose of antivenom required is much higher than that noted in an experimental animal study.35 41
PMC3016167,S182,,"The scorpion stinger by which venom is injected is short and sharp, 3-4 mm long, enabling it to deposit the venom skin deep (the full thickness of human skin is 1.5-4 mm)."
PMC3016167,S183,,Skin circulation is sluggish and normally remains quiescent.
PMC3016167,S184,,Soon after stinging the rapidly absorbed venom evokes autonomic storm owing to sudden pouring of endogenous catecholamine into the circulation.
PMC3016167,S185,,"Î±1 receptors are stimulated by the circulating catecholamine, causing cold skin as a result of vasoconstriction, which further arrests the absorption of venom from the sting site."
PMC3016167,S186,,"Toxicokinetic studies in rabbits showed that scorpion venom was rapidly taken up by organs and tissues, with an estimated half life of two to six minutes after venom injection.6"
PMC3016167,S187,,Moreover small doses of scorpion antivenom (such as the 10 mL dose used in a previous report of 25 cases from Mahad) have not been effective in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by Mesobuthus tamulus sting.
PMC3016167,S188,,This led us to conclude that the role of antivenom in severe scorpion sting needed to be re-examined and that prazosin is the standard of care to overcome the autonomic storm.37 38
PMC3016167,S189,,Strength and limitations
PMC3016167,S190,,We are not aware of any previous randomised controlled trials comparing the usefulness of mono-specific F(Ab)2 scorpion antivenom plus prazosin against prazosin alone in severe scorpion sting by Mesobuthus tamulus.
PMC3016167,S191,,"The number of cases of envenoming peaks in the hot months of the year, May and October (table 1) because of increased agricultural activities."
PMC3016167,S192,,Men are more prone to these accidents owing to greater environmental exposure (table 2).
PMC3016167,S193,,Twenty eight per cent of the study population were younger than 18 years.
PMC3016167,S194,,Our findings in relation to a substantial number of patients with grade 2 envenomation included in this study support a firm conclusion about the efficacy of antivenom plus prazosin in victims reporting within six hours of sting with systemic involvement.
PMC3016167,S195,,"Cases of grade 3 and grade 4 envenomation were not included in the present study, as required by the ethics committee."
PMC3016167,S196,,Large randomised trials including victims with grade 3 and 4 envenomation will be needed to demonstrate the effect of antivenom and prazosin on end points such as survival.
PMC3016167,S197,,"This study was not blinded and the primary outcome was evaluated by study investigators, albeit investigators with extensive clinical experience with scorpion sting.1 9 11 20 25 33 34"
PMC3016167,S198,,"The determination of the point at which symptoms disappeared was thus subjective, but we think that this was a clinically relevant and pragmatic way of judging the effects of treatment in a trial carried out in challenging circumstances with restricted resources in a rural setting in India."
PMC3016167,S199,,Scorpion venom evokes transient parasympathetic and prolonged sympathetic stimulation.
PMC3016167,S200,,"The presence of clinical signs and symptoms of excess acetylcholine indicate the presence of active free circulating venom in the blood, which can be neutralised by antivenom."
PMC3016167,S201,,"The sympathetic signs suggest after effects of venom on the sympathetic system, which are unresponsive to antivenom but reversible with prazosin."
PMC3016167,S202,,Moreover morbidity and mortality due to envenoming are caused by sympathetic overstimulation and not parasympathetic stimulation.1 2 3 4 11
PMC3016167,S203,,"Thus, early administration of antivenom in a stage of acetylcholine excess and prazosin to counteract the sympathetic and metabolic effects may be synergistic in enhancing recovery.1 2 3 4 10 12 15 17"
PMC3016167,S204,,"On arrival, absence of sweating and salivation that was present before reporting to the hospital suggests that venom has already reached the target site of action and is not accessible to the administration of antivenom,22 as in our patient who deteriorated to grade 4."
PMC3016167,S205,,"Total doses of prazosin required were significantly lower in the antivenom plus prazosin group than in the prazosin alone group, suggesting that timely administration of scorpion antivenom leads to rapid neutralisation of circulating venom, resulting in minimum venom available for neuronal sodium channel activation."
PMC3016167,S206,,"Amelioration of parasympathetic stimulation (sweating, salivation, arrhythmias) by antivenom may have accounted for the lower incidence of hypotension in the antivenom plus prazosin group."
PMC3016167,S207,,Leucocytosis and raised cardiac enzymes were suggestive of the release of cytokines such as interleukin-6.22 38
PMC3016167,S208,,No participant had a mild or severe reaction to antivenom.
PMC3016167,S209,,High circulating catecholamines induced by venom prevent a reaction to antivenom and act as a prophylaxis against anaphylaxis.42
PMC3016167,S210,,Administration of the minimum first dose of prazosin prevented the development of the first dose phenomenon.43
PMC3016167,S211,,Owing to unavailability of an ELISA test for detection of venom antigen and antivenom in blood we could not perform a correlation with clinical manifestations.
PMC3016167,S212,,Facilities for analysis of serum catecholamine levels are not available at Mahad.
PMC3016167,S213,,We could not enrol patients with grade 3 and 4 severe scorpion stings owing to restriction by the ethics committee.
PMC3016167,S214,,Withholding the lifesaving drug prazosin would be unethical in a life threatening situation; hence it was included in both the arms of the trial and no placebo group was included.
PMC3016167,S215,,Conclusions and policy implications
PMC3016167,S216,,Early administration of antivenom within six hours of sting in addition to prazosin hastened the recovery and shortened the hospital stay in a rural setting.
PMC3016167,S217,,"Although the rapid recovery in patients treated with antivenom is an advantage, the total cost of treatment with antivenom approaches a monthâ€™s salary for a labourer in the regionâ€”10 mL of antivenom costs Rs350 (Â£4.97, â‚¬5.82, $7.77)â€”while the cost of 10 tablets of 1 mg prazosin is Rs32 (Â£0.49, â‚¬0.58, $0.77)."
PMC3016167,S218,,The dose of prazosin administered was 250 Âµg in children up to age 18 and 500 Âµg in adults.
PMC3016167,S219,,Administration of prazosin at an interval of three hours prevented development of pulmonary oedema and led to rapid recovery as reported previously.33
PMC3016167,S220,,"The results of the present study would be applicable in settings such as primary health centres, where the majority of the victims first present.1"
PMC3016167,S221,,"Scorpion sting is a potentially life threatening time limiting acute medical emergency, hence it would be unethical to withhold the standard treatment for want of a scientific trial.33"
PMC3016167,S222,,"Despite much experience of severe scorpion envenomation in endemic regions throughout the world, a standard treatment protocol using drugs and antivenom is lacking.15 21 37"
PMC3016167,S223,,Randomised controlled trials for treatment of severe scorpion envenomation on which such guidelines can be based are scarce.18 19 20 21
PMC3016167,S224,,What is already known on this topic

PMC3018567,S3,,Summary
PMC3018567,S4,,Background
PMC3018567,S5,,Helminth infections affect the human immune response.
PMC3018567,S6,,We investigated whether prenatal exposure to and treatment of maternal helminth infections affects development of an infant's immune response to immunisations and unrelated infections.
PMC3018567,S7,,Methods
PMC3018567,S8,,"In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled 2507 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy who were planning to deliver in Entebbe General Hospital, Entebbe, Uganda."
PMC3018567,S9,,"With a computer-generated random number sequence in blocks of 100, we assigned patients to 440 mg albendazole and 40 mg/kg praziquantel (n=628), 440 mg albendazole and a praziquantel-matching placebo (n=625), 40 mg/kg praziquantel and an albendazole-matching placebo (n=626), or an albendazole-matching placebo and praziquantel-matching placebo (n=628)."
PMC3018567,S10,,All participants and hospital staff were masked to allocation.
PMC3018567,S11,,"Primary outcomes were immune response at age 1 year to BCG, tetanus, and measles immunisation; incidence of infectious diseases during infancy; and vertical HIV transmission."
PMC3018567,S12,,Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
PMC3018567,S13,,"This trial is registered, number ISRCTN32849447."
PMC3018567,S14,,Findings
PMC3018567,S15,,"Data were available at delivery for 2356 women, with 2345 livebirths; 2115 (90%) of liveborn infants remained in follow-up at 1 year of age."
PMC3018567,S16,,"Neither albendazole nor praziquantel treatments affected infant response to BCG, tetanus, or measles immunisation."
PMC3018567,S17,,"However, in infants of mothers with hookworm infection, albendazole treatment reduced interleukin-5 (geometric mean ratio 0Â·50, 95% CI 0Â·30â€“0Â·81, interaction p=0Â·02) and interleukin-13 (0Â·52, 0Â·34â€“0Â·82, 0Â·0005) response to tetanus toxoid."
PMC3018567,S18,,"The rate per 100 person-years of malaria was 40Â·9 (95% CI 38Â·3â€“43Â·7), of diarrhoea was 134Â·1 (129Â·2â€“139Â·2), and of pneumonia was 22Â·3 (20Â·4â€“24Â·4)."
PMC3018567,S19,,"We noted no effect on infectious disease incidence for albendazole treatment (malaria [hazard ratio 0Â·95, 95% CI 0Â·79â€“1.14], diarrhoea [1Â·06, 0Â·96â€“1Â·16], pneumonia [1Â·11, 0Â·90â€“1Â·38]) or praziquantel treatment (malaria [1Â·00, 0Â·84â€“1Â·20], diarrhoea [1Â·07, 0Â·98â€“1Â·18], pneumonia [1Â·00, 0Â·80â€“1Â·24])."
PMC3018567,S20,,"In HIV-exposed infants, 39 (18%) were infected at 6 weeks; vertical transmission was not associated with albendazole (odds ratio 0Â·70, 95% CI 0Â·35â€“1Â·42) or praziquantel (0Â·60, 0Â·29â€“1Â·23) treatment."

PMC3018567,S25,,Introduction
PMC3018567,S26,,"Worldwide, infectious diseases account for more than 50% of deaths of children younger than 5 years; pneumonia, diarrhoeal disease, and malaria are the three most common causes.1"
PMC3018567,S27,,"More than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where roughly 2Â·5 million children younger than 5 years are estimated to die every year from one of these three diseases."
PMC3018567,S28,,"Immunisation is a key strategy to combat infectious diseases, but immunisation programmes in developing countries vary in effectiveness.2"
PMC3018567,S29,,"For example, increases in measles immunisation coverage have led to substantial falls in the incidence of measles;3 by contrast, despite high immunisation coverage, the prevalence of tuberculosis is high in sub-Saharan Africa, and is one of the leading causes of deaths in adults.4"
PMC3018567,S30,,"BCG is the only available vaccine against tuberculosis and its effectiveness is lowest in countries closest to the equator.5,6"
PMC3018567,S31,,"Soil-transmitted helminth infections and schistosomiasis are also prevalent in developing countries,7 and their geographical distribution has extensive overlap with areas in which rates of infectious diseases are highest and the effectiveness of BCG immunisation is lowest.8,9"
PMC3018567,S32,,"Such overlap in disease distributions has led to the suggestion that chronic helminth infections could affect the epidemiological patterns of other diseases,10 through impairment of immune responses to immunisations and unrelated infections."
PMC3018567,S33,,"This hypothesis was supported by the finding that T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses (characterised by interferon-Î_ production, induced by viral and bacterial antigens, and required for protection against mycobacteria and other intracellular pathogens) and T-helper-2 (Th2) cell responses (characterised by production of interleukins 4, 5, and 13 and induced by allergens such as helminth antigens) are mutually inhibitory.11â€“13"
PMC3018567,S34,,"However, helminth infections induce immunoregulation by various other mechanisms, such as interleukin-10 production, and affect responses to non-helminth antigens.14"
PMC3018567,S35,,"Thus helminth infections could inhibit protective Th1 responses to unrelated organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and vaccines, by inducing a Th1 to Th2 switch and through immunoregulatory mechanisms."
PMC3018567,S36,,Several studies of animals and human beings lend support to this hypothesis.14
PMC3018567,S37,,"Although helminth infections are generally thought to have detrimental effects on host responses to infectious pathogens, a beneficial effect against other diseases is also possible through suppression of pathological inflammatory responses; some researchers have suggested an inverse association between helminth infections and incidence of severe malaria.15"
PMC3018567,S38,,"Helminth infections are rare in infancy, when immunisations are given and many infectious disease-related deaths occur."
PMC3018567,S39,,"However, evidence exists that prenatal exposure to maternal helminth infection could have important effects on an infant's immune response."
PMC3018567,S40,,"Prenatal sensitisation to Wuchereria bancrofti, a filarial worm, is associated with increased susceptibility to W bancrofti infection in childhood,16 and prenatal sensitisation to filarial or schistosome antigens with reduced Th1 and increased Th2 cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens after BCG immunisation at birth.2,17"
PMC3018567,S41,,"Such findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal helminth infection modulates an infant's immune response to vaccination and infectious pathogens, and that anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy can prevent these effects."
PMC3018567,S42,,We designed this trial of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy to address this hypothesis.
PMC3018567,S43,,"We also examined effects of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy on infant mortality, and on anaemia and growth at age 1 year, to assess the overall risks and benefits of anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy."

PMC3018567,S133,,The figure shows the trial profile.
PMC3018567,S134,,"2507 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups, 1309 (52%) of whom were in the second trimester of pregnancy and 1195 (48%) of whom were in the third trimester of pregnancy."
PMC3018567,S135,,The median length of time between receiving the study intervention and delivery was 87 days (IQR 54â€“118).
PMC3018567,S136,,"Data were available for 2356 women (94%) at delivery and there were 2345 livebirths; results for 30 liveborn younger twins or triplets were excluded, which left data for follow-up of 2315 liveborn infants."
PMC3018567,S137,,"Of these infants, 2092 (90%) remained in follow-up at 1 year of age, of whom 1701 (81%) attended the 1-year visit."
PMC3018567,S138,,Baseline characteristics of mothers were similar between the four groups (table 1).37
PMC3018567,S139,,"Mothers of children who did not contribute to follow-up were, on average, younger, more likely to be pregnant for the first time, have malaria or HIV infection, and have enrolled earlier during pregnancy than mothers of children who contributed to follow up (data not shown)."
PMC3018567,S140,,Mothers of children who provided samples at 1 year of age were of higher socioeconomic status and less likely to reside in remote parts of the study area than were mothers of children who did not provide samples at age 1 year (data not shown).
PMC3018567,S141,,"At enrolment, 1693 (68%) of women were infected with at least one helminth species."
PMC3018567,S142,,"Individual prevalences of each species were: hookworm 45%, M perstans 21%, S mansoni 18%, S stercoralis 12%, Trichuris trichiura 9%, and Ascaris lumbricoides 2%."
PMC3018567,S143,,"Infections were generally mild, with 942 (85%) of hookworm infections and 297 (65%) of S mansoni infections classified as light."
PMC3018567,S144,,"Subgroups of 648 mothers who received albendazole-matching placebo and 658 mothers who received praziquantel-matching placebo had three stool samples examined before being treated 6 weeks after delivery; in these women, the sensitivity of one stool sample compared with three stool samples was 89% for hookworm infection and 66% for schistosomiasis."
PMC3018567,S145,,1957 mothers (78%) received at least one documented dose of tetanus immunisation during pregnancy; 1447 (74%) received all documented tetanus immunisations before the anthelmintic treatment intervention (median 4 days [IQR 3â€“7] before intervention).
PMC3018567,S146,,We noted no evidence of interaction between maternal albendazole and praziquantel treatments for any outcome (all interaction p values>0Â·1; webappendix pp 3â€“4); therefore the effects of each treatment were assessed independently.
PMC3018567,S147,,"Results for cytokine responses at age 1 year were available for 1542 infants, of whom 1506 had received BCG immunisation at birth at Entebbe Hospital and 1015 had received all three doses of tetanus immunisation at Entebbe Hospital."
PMC3018567,S148,,"The proportion of infants for whom positive responses to cCFP and tetanus toxoid were detected varied by cytokine; for cCFP, 1356 (90%) infants had positive responses to interferon-Î_, 449 (30%) had positive responses to interleukin 5, 1005 (67%) had positive responses to interleukin 13, and 1316 (87%) had positive responses to interleukin-10."
PMC3018567,S149,,"For tetanus toxoid, 655 (65%) infants had positive responses to interferon-Î_, 499 (49%) had positive responses to interleukin 5, 766 (75%) had positive responses to interleukin 13, and 498 (49%) had positive responses to interleukin 10."
PMC3018567,S150,,"Albendazole treatment of mothers was associated with a small reduction in unstimulated interleukin-10 production by their children (geometric mean ratio 0Â·83, 95% CI 0Â·70â€“0Â·98)."
PMC3018567,S151,,We recorded no other overall effects of maternal treatment on unstimulated cytokine production.
PMC3018567,S152,,"Results for effects on responses to stimulation were similar, irrespective of whether background cytokine production was subtracted (data not shown)."

PMC3018567,S154,,"Table 3 Effect of maternal anthelmintic treatment on response to BCG, tetanus, and measles immunisation, by maternal helminth infection status"
PMC3018567,S155,,We detected no effects of either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on the overall antigen-specific response after immunisation (table 2).
PMC3018567,S156,,"However, in infants of mothers with a hookworm infection, maternal albendazole treatment was associated with a small non-significant reduction in the interferon-Î_ response to cCFP and with reductions in their response to tetanus toxoid for the type 2 cytokines interleukin 5 and interleukin 13 (table 3)."
PMC3018567,S157,,We recorded no significant effect of praziquantel treatment in infants of mothers with schistosomiasis (table 3).
PMC3018567,S158,,"We recorded no overall effects for either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on antibody concentrations for tetanus or measles (table 2), nor did we detect differential effects for either albendazole or praziquantel treatment according to susceptible worm species (table 3)."
PMC3018567,S159,,"Of the 2315 liveborn children, 2083 (90%) made at least one illness-related clinic visit during infancy."
PMC3018567,S160,,The number of illness visits by children in all four treatment groups were similar (webappendix p 4).
PMC3018567,S161,,"During the study period, the rate of malaria was 41 episodes per 100 person-years (95% CI 38â€“44), of diarrhoea 134 episodes per 100 person-years (129â€“139), and of pneumonia 22 episodes per 100 person-years (20â€“24)."
PMC3018567,S162,,"Measles and tuberculosis were rare, with two episodes of each, so we could not assess the effect of maternal anthelmintic treatment on their frequency."

PMC3018567,S165,,"We noted no evidence for effects of either albendazole or praziquantel treatments on doctor-diagnosed malaria, diarrhoea, or pneumonia incidence (table 4)."
PMC3018567,S166,,Subgroup analyses by maternal hookworm and schistosomiasis infection status showed no evidence of a differential effect of either treatment according to susceptible worm species (table 5).
PMC3018567,S167,,"299 women tested positive for HIV at enrolment; of these, 16 were lost to follow-up before delivery, five had miscarriages, and nine had stillbirths."
PMC3018567,S168,,"Five women were on highly-active antiretroviral therapy; their children, and seven second-born twins were excluded from the analysis, leaving 264 infants suitable for inclusion."
PMC3018567,S169,,"6-week blood samples were available from 211 infants (80%), of whom 39 (18%) were diagnosed with HIV infection."
PMC3018567,S170,,"Of infants with HIV infection, 31 had cord samples available, of which 20 (65%) showed an HIV viral load of 1000 copies per mL or more, which is consistent with intrauterine HIV transmission."
PMC3018567,S171,,"We recorded no evidence for any effect of either albendazole (OR 0Â·70, 95% CI 0Â·35â€“1Â·42; p=0Â·33) or praziquantel (0Â·60, 0Â·29â€“1Â·23; p=0Â·17) treatment on vertical HIV transmission, although statistical power was restricted because the study was only powered to detect a large effect for this outcome."
PMC3018567,S172,,No evidence was noted for any differential effect of treatment according to susceptible worm species; ORs for the effect of albendazole treatment on HIV transmission were 0Â·77 (0Â·25â€“2Â·40) in mothers with hookworm infection and 0Â·66 (0Â·27â€“1Â·60) in those without hookworm infection (interaction p=0Â·83).
PMC3018567,S173,,"We recorded similar results for praziquantel (OR 0Â·75, 0Â·18â€“3Â·14, for mothers with schistosomiasis; 0Â·56, 0Â·24â€“1Â·29 for those without schistosomiasis; interaction p=0Â·73)."
PMC3018567,S174,,"For the secondary outcome of community-reported illness data, the overall recorded prevalences of each illness collated every 14 days throughout infancy was 13% for febrile illness, 12% for diarrhoea, and 1% for presumptive pneumonia."
PMC3018567,S175,,"These data were consistent with doctor-diagnosed outcomes and showed no effects of treatment with albendazole or praziquantel on febrile illnesses (OR 1Â·07, 95% CI 0Â·97â€“1Â·18, p=0Â·18; and 1Â·03, 0Â·93â€“1Â·13, 0Â·58), diarrhoea (1Â·08, 0Â·98â€“1Â·20, 0Â·13; and 0Â·93, 0Â·84â€“1Â·03, 0Â·18), or presumptive pneumonia (0Â·92, 0Â·65â€“1Â·31, 0Â·66; and 0Â·91, 0Â·64â€“1Â·30, 0Â·62)."
PMC3018567,S176,,The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia at 1 year was similar between treatment groups (webappendix p 5).
PMC3018567,S177,,"81 infants in the cohort died, 44 of whom were neonates, giving a neonatal mortality rate of 19Â·0 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 14Â·2â€“25Â·5) and an infant mortality rate of 35Â·7 per 1000 livebirths (28Â·8â€“44Â·2)."
PMC3018567,S178,,Maternal anthelmintic treatment had no pronounced effect on mortality (webappendix p 5).
PMC3018567,S179,,"Height-for-age and weight-for-age Z scores were low compared with the WHO standards; however, the weight-for-height distribution was similar."
PMC3018567,S180,,Mean haemoglobin score at age 1 year was 102 g/L (SD 14 g/L).
PMC3018567,S181,,"We noted no evidence for any difference in mean growth indices or mean haemoglobin between children of albendazole-treated and placebo-treated mothers, or between children of praziquantel-treated and placebo-treated mothers (webappendix p 5)."
PMC3018567,S182,,Numbers of serious adverse events are reported elsewhere19 and were distributed evenly between treatment groups.
PMC3018567,S183,,Discussion
PMC3018567,S184,,"In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we have shown that maternal anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy can have a small effect on an infant's response to tetanus immunisation, but has no effects, either beneficial or detrimental, on the occurrence of infectious diseases during infancy, infant mortality, or growth and anaemia outcomes at 1 year of age."
PMC3018567,S185,,"One dose of albendazole was effective for the treatment of hookworm and A lumbricoides infections, and praziquantel was effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis."
PMC3018567,S186,,"At delivery, the prevalence of hookworm infections had decreased to 5% in the albendazole group, and remained at 45% in the placebo group; the prevalence of S mansoni infection had decreased to 5% in the praziquantel group, and remained at 21% in the placebo group.37"
PMC3018567,S187,,Thus we would have expected to see any noticeable effects of the removal of these maternal helminth infections.
PMC3018567,S188,,"A possible source of imprecision is that the Kato-Katz method has suboptimum sensitivity for diagnosis of intestinal helminth infections when one stool sample is used.38,39"
PMC3018567,S189,,"In this study, the sensitivity for detecting both hookworm infection and schistosomiasis was greater when three stool samples were taken than when only one was taken."
PMC3018567,S190,,"As expected, one dose of albendazole was not effective for treatment of S stercoralis, T trichiura, or M perstans.37"
PMC3018567,S191,,Albendazole treatment in pregnancy was associated with reduced interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 responses to tetanus toxoid in infants of mothers with hookworm infection.
PMC3018567,S192,,"These results should be interpreted with caution because of the large number of statistical tests done, but they accord with earlier findings40,41 on effects of helminths on type-2 responses to tetanus immunisation in adults; by contrast with these previous studies,40,41 we recorded no reciprocal effect on interferon-Î_ response."
PMC3018567,S193,,"Such responses will probably not change the effectiveness of tetanus immunisation, because this immunisation depends on the production of toxin-neutralising IgG antibodies, which was not affected by maternal treatment."
PMC3018567,S194,,"However, the patterns recorded lend support to the hypothesis that maternal helminths promote a type-2 bias in an infant's response to unrelated antigens and that anthelmintic treatment modifies this effect."
PMC3018567,S195,,These findings suggest that the effect of anthelmintic treatment can be transmitted in utero.
PMC3018567,S196,,Neither intervention showed any overall effect on response to BCG immunisation in infants.
PMC3018567,S197,,Our preliminary study32 had suggested an unexpected positive association between maternal hookworm infection and interferon-Î_ responses to cCFP in infants.
PMC3018567,S198,,"In the present, larger study, interferon-Î_ responses were higher in infants of mothers with hookworm infection, and albendazole treatment was associated with a weak reduction in interferon-Î_ responses in infants of women with hookworm infection."
PMC3018567,S199,,These findings contrast with our initial hypothesis that maternal hookworm infection would inhibit the Th1 response and that albendazole treatment would reverse this effect.
PMC3018567,S200,,"The absence of effect of praziquantel treatment was also unexpected, in view of Malhotra and colleagues' finding17 that infants who are sensitised to schistosome or filarial antigens in utero had reduced interferon-Î_ and increased interleukin-5 responses to neonatal BCG immunisation."
PMC3018567,S201,,"However, all infants in Malhotra and colleagues' study were exposed to maternal helminth infections, and comparisons were made between those not sensitised or sensitised to helminth antigens.17"
PMC3018567,S202,,"The idea that single-dose praziquantel treatment completely removes the likelihood of fetal sensitisation to schistosome antigens might be too simplistic, because worm and egg antigens can take some time to be cleared from maternal tissues."
PMC3018567,S203,,"Moreover, the killing of adult schistosomes results in release of worm antigen into the circulation and might have complex effects on the fetus, dependent on placental transfer of antigens or antibodies and the stage of development of the fetal immune system.41,42"
PMC3018567,S204,,The recorded effects on an infant's response to tetanus immunisation contrasted with the absence of effects seen for measles and BCG.
PMC3018567,S205,,"A possible explanation is that tetanus immunisation given to women during pregnancy could have led to the priming of an infant's antitetanus response in utero,42 and the profile of the primed response could have been affected by concomitant exposure to a maternal helminth infection, which depended on whether or not an infant's mother received treatment with albendazole."
PMC3018567,S206,,"In keeping with the broad absence of effect of maternal anthelmintic treatment on an infant's response to vaccination, we recorded no effect of either treatment for the co-primary outcome of infectious disease incidence during infancy."
PMC3018567,S207,,"A possible source of imprecision is that data for doctor-diagnosed disease incidence were obtained passively, and therefore rates are likely to have been underestimated."
PMC3018567,S208,,"However, 90% of infants attended the clinic for illness at least once, and underestimation would be non-differential between treatment groups; therefore this imprecision is unlikely to have affected our findings."
PMC3018567,S209,,"Moreover, results from community-reported illness events (which are less likely to be under-reported), and malaria parasitaemia at 1 year of age (which is independent of reporting biases) were both consistent with the recorded absence of treatment effect."
PMC3018567,S210,,"We also detected no evidence that anthelmintic treatment affected vertical transmission of HIV, although power to detect an effect was restricted."
PMC3018567,S211,,"The only other study43 to investigate the relation between anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy and post-neonatal outcomes, undertaken in Nepal, showed that treatment with albendazole during pregnancy was associated with a pronounced reduction in infant mortality at 6 months."
PMC3018567,S212,,"We recorded no such effect, although the number of deaths in the cohort was small so the possibility of a reduction cannot be ruled out."
PMC3018567,S213,,The Nepal study was not randomised and recorded a 41% reduction in 6-month mortality associated with two doses of albendazole but no effect on infant mortality for one dose.
PMC3018567,S214,,"The researchers speculated that the greater benefit of two doses might result from prevention of reinfection between treatment and delivery, but this theory would not explain the contrast with our findings, because only 5% of women who received albendazole in our study had hookworm infection at delivery.19"
PMC3018567,S215,,"Our analyses needed many statistical tests, especially for the measurement of cytokine responses to immunisation, because we aimed to assess overall response profiles rather than concentrations of only one cytokine."
PMC3018567,S216,,"Consistency between all cytokine responses was expected, and can be interpreted as compelling evidence of an effect, compared with isolated change in an individual response."
PMC3018567,S217,,Therefore we did not increase confidence limits or use methods that assume independence of tests to formally adjust p values.
PMC3018567,S218,,"In the event, very few outcomes showed any evidence of association at a p value less than 0Â·05 so absence of adjustment for multiplicity is unlikely to have affected the interpretation of our results."
PMC3018567,S219,,A strength of this study was the randomised intervention design; effects of helminth infections reported in observational studies could have been affected by confounding factors.
PMC3018567,S220,,Our findings do not show that exposure to maternal helminth infections in utero has no important effect on the development of the fetal immune system.
PMC3018567,S221,,"Some observational studies16,17 do suggest such an effect."
PMC3018567,S222,,"Rather, our findings suggest that one effective anthelmintic intervention given in the second or third trimester of pregnancy is insufficient to alter any effect of maternal worms on vaccine and infectious disease outcomes in infancy."
PMC3018567,S223,,This study examined only effects of maternal anthelmintic treatment on vaccine responses and disease incidence in newborn children.
PMC3018567,S224,,Further studies are needed to assess the effects of anthelmintic treatment on these outcomes in the individual who receives the treatment.
PMC3018567,S225,,"Our results are generalisable to areas with high prevalence but low intensity of helminth infection in young adults, which is a common pattern in areas that are endemic for helminth infection."
PMC3018567,S226,,Findings might differ in populations with higher infection intensities.
PMC3018567,S227,,"These results suggest that, in settings such as Entebbe Municipality and Katabi subcounty, single-dose anthelmintic treatment during pregnancy has no benefit for an infant's response to immunisation, or for their health and development."
PMC3018567,S228,,We have previously reported a similar absence of effect on maternal and perinatal outcomes.37
PMC3018567,S229,,"These results contrast with the expected benefits of routine antenatal anthelmintic treatment recently advocated,44 and the value of such a policy may need to be reviewed."
PMC3018567,S230,,"The study cohort is being followed up to establish whether these conclusions are still valid up to when children are aged 5 years, and to relate effects on the cytokine response to BCG immunisation to incidence of M tuberculosis infection and disease.18"

PMC3028347,S2,,Effects of Metformin on Body Weight and Body Composition in Obese Insulin-Resistant Children
PMC3028347,S3,,Abstract
PMC3028347,S4,,OBJECTIVE
PMC3028347,S5,,"Metformin can decrease adiposity and ameliorate obesity-related comorbid conditions, including abnormalities in glucose homeostasis in adolescents, but there are few data evaluating the efficacy of metformin among younger children."
PMC3028347,S6,,"Our objective was to determine whether metformin treatment causes weight loss and improves obesity-related comorbidities in obese children, who are insulin-resistant."
PMC3028347,S7,,RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
PMC3028347,S8,,"This study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial consisting of 100 severely obese (mean BMI 34.6 Â± 6.6 kg/m2) insulin-resistant children aged 6â€“12 years, randomized to 1,000 mg metformin (n = 53) or placebo (n = 47) twice daily for 6 months, followed by open-label metformin treatment for 6 months."
PMC3028347,S9,,All children and their parents participated in a monthly dietitian-administered weight-reduction program.
PMC3028347,S10,,RESULTS
PMC3028347,S11,,Eighty-five percent completed the 6-month randomized phase.
PMC3028347,S12,,"Children prescribed metformin had significantly greater decreases in BMI (difference âˆ’1.09 kg/m2, CI âˆ’1.87 to âˆ’0.31, P = 0.006), body weight (difference âˆ’3.38 kg, CI âˆ’5.2 to âˆ’1.57, P < 0.001), BMI Z score (difference between metformin and placebo groups âˆ’0.07, CI âˆ’0.12 to âˆ’0.01, P = 0.02), and fat mass (difference âˆ’1.40 kg, CI âˆ’2.74 to âˆ’0.06, P = 0.04)."
PMC3028347,S13,,Fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.007) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) insulin resistance index (P = 0.006) also improved more in metformin-treated children than in placebo-treated children.
PMC3028347,S14,,"Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly more prevalent in metformin-treated children, which limited maximal tolerated dosage in 17%."
PMC3028347,S15,,"During the 6-month open-label phase, children treated previously with placebo decreased their BMI Z score; those treated continuously with metformin did not significantly change BMI Z score further."
PMC3028347,S16,,CONCLUSIONS
PMC3028347,S17,,"Metformin had modest but favorable effects on body weight, body composition, and glucose homeostasis in obese insulin-resistant children participating in a low-intensity weight-reduction program."
PMC3028347,S18,,The prevalence of pediatric obesity has increased substantially since the 1970s; 19.6% of children 6â€“11 years of age are now considered obese (BMI â‰¥95th percentile standard for age and sex) (1).
PMC3028347,S19,,Excess body fat in children is associated with insulin resistance and dysglycemia (2) and predicts development of the metabolic syndrome in adulthood (3).
PMC3028347,S20,,"Insulin resistance is of particular concern because it is independently associated with metabolic abnormalities during childhood (2,4) and development of type 2 diabetes (5â€“7)."
PMC3028347,S21,,"Intensive behavioral treatments, which may reduce adiposity among children with moderately increased body weight (8), have limited efficacy among individuals most severely affected (9â€“12), leading to interest in developing other effective approaches."
PMC3028347,S22,,There have been few controlled pediatric trials of antiobesity agents.
PMC3028347,S23,,There are currently no medications that are approved by the U.S.
PMC3028347,S24,,Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat obesity in children <12 years of age.
PMC3028347,S25,,Metformin recently received attention for its potential to assist in pediatric weight control efforts (13).
PMC3028347,S26,,"Metformin is FDA-approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes in children age â‰¥10 years; it suppresses hepatic glucose production (14) and, at high concentrations, improves peripheral insulin sensitivity (15)."
PMC3028347,S27,,Metformin induces weight stabilization or small weight losses in diabetic (16â€“19) and nondiabetic (20â€“23) adults.
PMC3028347,S28,,"Case series involving obese children (24â€“26) and relatively small randomized trials in obese adolescents (27â€“33), including one 48-week multicenter trial (33), also suggest that metformin may induce small BMI/weight reductions, averaging âˆ_1.4 kg/m2 (3 kg) over 6 months (34,35) and 1.1 kg/m2 over 1 year (33)."
PMC3028347,S29,,"Small trials also suggest that metformin has a positive impact on insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (36,37) or precocious pubarche (38,39)."
PMC3028347,S30,,"However, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effect of metformin on body weight and body composition in severely obese children age 6â€“12 years."
PMC3028347,S31,,Studies involving this age-group are important because some research suggests that obesity may be more tractable when treated during childhood (40).
PMC3028347,S32,,We studied the effects of metformin in obese children aged 6â€“12 years who were believed to be at particular risk because they manifested a significant degree of insulin resistance.
PMC3028347,S33,,"We hypothesized that, in the context of a weight-reduction program, metformin would decrease childrenâ€™s body weight, BMI, and fat mass; improve insulin sensitivity; and ameliorate aspects of the metabolic syndrome."

PMC3028347,S115,,RESULTS
PMC3028347,S116,,A total of 100 children were randomly assigned to the two study groups (Fig. 1).
PMC3028347,S117,,There were no significant demographic differences between subjects who participated and subjects who declined.
PMC3028347,S118,,Participants had evidence of significant insulin resistance; a family history of type 2 diabetes was also frequently reported (Table 1).
PMC3028347,S119,,"When separated into prepubertal subjects and subjects who had evidence for pubertal onset (i.e., in boys, testes >3 mL; in girls Tanner II or greater breast stage), there were no significant differences between groups in demographic, historical, or laboratory data (all P > 0.46), including degree of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR metformin prepubertal: 4.3 Â± 2.0, pubertal: 4.6 Â± 2.3; placebo prepubertal: 4.5 Â± 4.1, pubertal: 5.0 Â± 2.9)."

PMC3028347,S122,,"Of the participants, 85% completed the 6-month randomized trial (85% metformin; 85% placebo, P = 0.98)."
PMC3028347,S123,,"Among the 85 offered open-label metformin, 67% completed the second 6-month study phase (Fig. 1)."
PMC3028347,S124,,Sociodemographic and baseline anthropometric or laboratory indexes did not significantly differ between participants who did and did not complete either phase of the study (all P > 0.65).
PMC3028347,S125,,Changes in body weight and body composition.
PMC3028347,S126,,"During the placebo-controlled randomized phase (Table 2 and Fig. 2), both metformin-treated and placebo-treated children significantly reduced BMI Z (P values <0.01); however, children given metformin had significantly greater decreases in BMI Z (difference between metformin and placebo groups âˆ’0.07, 95th CI âˆ’0.12 to âˆ’0.01, P = 0.02), BMI (difference âˆ’1.09 kg/m2, CI âˆ’1.87 to âˆ’0.31, P = 0.006), body weight (difference âˆ’3.38 kg, CI âˆ’5.2 to âˆ’1.57, P < 0.001), and total-body fat mass (P < 0.05)."
PMC3028347,S127,,Three metformin-treated versus 0 placebo-treated children lost sufficient weight to reach a BMI <97th percentile after 6 month of treatment (P = 0.25).
PMC3028347,S128,,"Body circumference and skinfold thickness measurements decreased to a significantly greater extent in the metformin-treated children, although changes in intra-abdominal fat did not differ significantly between groups (Table 2)."
PMC3028347,S129,,"During the open-label phase, subjects who previously received placebo significantly decreased BMI Z; subjects treated continuously with metformin had nonsignificant increases in BMI Z (Fig. 2) compared with their 6-month values and increases in absolute BMI consistent with those expected to occur as children mature."
PMC3028347,S130,,"Subjects examined at the end of the open-label phase had significantly lower BMI Z at the end of the 12-month treatment period when compared with their BMI Z values at baseline (âˆ’0.091, CI âˆ’0.183 to âˆ’0.001, P = 0.05)."
PMC3028347,S131,,"Additional analyses that included an interaction term for race Ã— treatment group found non-Hispanic black participants decreased body mass less than non-Hispanic or Hispanic whites during the randomized treatment phase (BMI Z âˆ’0.035 Â± 0.021 vs. âˆ’0.108 Â± 0.017, difference 0.073, CI 0.020â€“0.127, P = 0.008), but the interaction between race and treatment group was not significantly different (P = 0.064)."
PMC3028347,S132,,"When severity of insulin resistance or pubertal status at baseline was included in the statistical model for the primary or secondary body composition outcomes, no significant impact for severity of insulin resistance or puberty on treatment success was identified, even after race was removed from the analysis (all P â‰¥ 0.20)."

PMC3028347,S145,,Changes in other laboratory values commonly observed to improve with significant weight reduction did not differ significantly between the groups (Table 3).

PMC3028347,S148,,No serious or life-threatening adverse events were reported.
PMC3028347,S149,,No subject developed abnormal AST or ALT concentrations or acidosis.
PMC3028347,S150,,"Serum vitamin B12 remained within the normal range (220â€“960 pg/mL) in all subjects throughout the 12-month study, but decreased in the metformin-treated group, compared with the increase observed in placebo-treated children during the randomized phase (âˆ’57 Â± 58 vs. 173 Â± 67 pg/mL, P < 0.001)."
PMC3028347,S151,,No metformin-associated difference in hemoglobin concentrations was observed (P = 0.53).
PMC3028347,S152,,Gastrointestinal complaints were significantly more prevalent among subjects treated with metformin.
PMC3028347,S153,,"More metformin- than placebo-treated subjects reported at least one episode of liquid or loose stools (41.5%, CI 30.1â€“55.9% vs. 17%, CI 7.6â€“30.8%, P = 0.01) and vomiting (41.5%, CI 29.1â€“55.9% vs. 21.3%, CI 10.7â€“32.7%, P = 0.05)."
PMC3028347,S154,,"Fatigue was also significantly more likely to be reported (P = 0.02) among metformin-treated (37.7%, CI 24.8â€“52.1%) than placebo-treated (14.9%, CI 6.2â€“28.3%) children."
PMC3028347,S155,,"One metformin-treated child lost interest in usual pleasurable activities that resolved with medication discontinuation, but this adverse event did not recur during a rechallenge."
PMC3028347,S156,,Reported metformin-associated symptomatology was most prevalent in the first month of treatment and then decreased such that no reported symptom was significantly different in prevalence between the two groups at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (Fig. 3) or during the open-label phase.

PMC3028347,S165,,"Children for whom the full metformin dose could not be prescribed were younger (8.8 Â± 1.9 vs. 10.3 Â± 1.4 years, P = 0.01) but did not differ in BMI or fat mass from those who tolerated it."

PMC3028347,S167,,DISCUSSION
PMC3028347,S168,,"Childhood-onset obesity presages the development of disorders that predispose to cardiovascular disease in later life (47,48)."
PMC3028347,S169,,"Prevention of the complications of obesity, including type 2 diabetes, thus is a primary medical goal for weight-reduction therapy in children."
PMC3028347,S170,,"On the basis of evidence suggesting that adolescents given metformin have salutary changes in adiposity and obesity-related comorbid conditions (27â€“33) and data from adults suggesting that metformin can delay the incidence of type 2 diabetes (22,23), we tested the hypothesis that metformin could improve glucose homeostasis and decrease the weight and body fat gained by obese insulin-resistant 6- to 12-year-old children who participated in a low-intensity clinic-based weight-reduction program."
PMC3028347,S171,,"Metformin produced modest differences in BMI Z that, as found for adolescents (33), largely persisted during 1 year of treatment."
PMC3028347,S172,,"Compared with placebo treatment, metformin improved several other measures of body fatness, although consistent with some (33) but not all (29,39) studies, metformin did not significantly change intra-abdominal adipose tissue."
PMC3028347,S173,,"As might be anticipated because of its major effect to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis (14), metformin improved fasting insulin, glucose, and the HOMA-IR index, measures of insulin sensitivity that appear principally to reflect hepatic sensitivity to insulinâ€™s actions (49), but metformin did not greatly alter whole-body (primarily muscle) insulin sensitivity."
PMC3028347,S174,,"Among young adult Israeli army recruits, individuals with fasting glucose concentrations >86 mg/dL had monotonically increasing risks for developing diabetes during âˆ_6 years of follow-up (50)."
PMC3028347,S175,,"Our subjectsâ€™ mean baseline plasma glucose was 92 mg/dL, decreasing slightly among metformin-treated children but increasing an additional 3.5 mg/dL in the placebo-treated group."
PMC3028347,S176,,The finding that metformin enabled study subjects to maintain fasting plasma glucose at a lower level suggests the possibility that metformin treatment might prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in children at high risk for this disorder.
PMC3028347,S177,,Other aspects of the insulin resistanceâ€“related metabolic syndrome did not change significantly with metformin treatment.
PMC3028347,S178,,"The limited weight change observed, perhaps combined with the worsening of whole-body insulin resistance that commonly occurs as children enter adolescence, may account for the failure to find greater improvements in metabolism as a result of metformin treatment in this and prior studies conducted among adolescents (33,35)."
PMC3028347,S179,,"Metformin therapy was associated with dose-limiting side effects in almost 17% of participants, particularly among younger subjects."
PMC3028347,S180,,"Inability to tolerate 2,000 mg/day despite efforts made to reach the full dose may have limited the efficacy that could be observed."
PMC3028347,S181,,"To some extent, the variability in the dose administered makes determination of metforminâ€™s efficacy more difficult."
PMC3028347,S182,,"Our data suggest that a target total daily dose of 2,000 mg/day may not be achievable for all young children treated with metformin."
PMC3028347,S183,,"Other studies report good toleration of lower doses (39) but a similar side effect profile among adolescents treated with 2,000 mg/day extended-release metformin (33)."
PMC3028347,S184,,"In addition to nausea and loose stools, we also observed fatigue symptomatology previously reported among children given metformin."
PMC3028347,S185,,"Lastly, there was a relative diminution of serum vitamin B12 despite provision of a cyanocobalamin-containing multivitamin."
PMC3028347,S186,,"B12 deficiency is unlikely to be reported among children treated with metformin because a long period of inadequate dietary B12 intake is required before clinical deficiency becomes manifest, but metformin has been reported to diminish serum B12 by 14â€“30% in adults, with the greatest effects observed among individuals treated with metformin for the longest time at the highest dosage (51)."
PMC3028347,S187,,Our data reinforce the importance of monitoring potential adverse events among patients treated chronically with metformin.
PMC3028347,S188,,"Although this study is among the largest randomized controlled trials to date of a pharmacotherapeutic agent conducted for amelioration of obesity among young children, a limitation of this study is that only 100 children were studied; thus, there may have been insufficient power to detect differences between placebo- and metformin-treated groups for some obesity-related comorbid conditions examined."
PMC3028347,S189,,"The placebo-controlled interval was only 6 months in duration and the maximal treatment duration was 1 year; thus, the study did not explore the efficacy of metformin in the longer term, which is required for a chronic condition like obesity."
PMC3028347,S190,,The studyâ€™s generalizability is also somewhat limited by the fact that only severely obese insulin-resistant children were enrolled; it remains unclear how efficacious metformin is among children who are less obese and insulin resistant.
PMC3028347,S191,,Wilson et al. (33) have found quite similar results among adolescents who were not required to have insulin resistance.
PMC3028347,S192,,"Finally, because the weight loss intervention was intended to model to some extent what might be available in clinical practice, it consisted solely of monthly visits with a dietitian, and the magnitude of metformin-associated weight reduction that might occur among children treated with an intensified behavioral modification regimen is not established."
PMC3028347,S193,,"Strengths include the recruitment of children who were racially and ethnically diverse, the use of intensive assessments of body composition and insulin sensitivity, the careful determination of adverse events using structured reporting tools, and the excellent subject retention rate."
PMC3028347,S194,,We conclude that metformin treatment modestly reduces body weight and adiposity and improves measures of glucose homeostasis in obese insulin-resistant 6- to 12-year-old children.
PMC3028347,S195,,"Although the weight loss produced is small, metformin treatment may hold promise as a method to prevent or delay the appearance of impaired glucose homeostasis in children at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes."

PMC3036630,S2,,Airway inflammation and mannitol challenge test in COPD
PMC3036630,S3,,Abstract
PMC3036630,S4,,Background
PMC3036630,S5,,Eosinophilic airway inflammation has successfully been used to tailor anti-inflammatory therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
PMC3036630,S6,,Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) by indirect challenges is associated with airway inflammation.
PMC3036630,S7,,We hypothesized that AHR to inhaled mannitol captures eosinophilia in induced sputum in COPD.
PMC3036630,S8,,Methods
PMC3036630,S9,,"Twenty-eight patients (age 58 Â± 7.8 yr, packyears 40 Â± 15.5, post-bronchodilator FEV1 77 Â± 14.0%predicted, no inhaled steroids â‰¥4 wks) with mild-moderate COPD (GOLD I-II) completed two randomized visits with hypertonic saline-induced sputum and mannitol challenge (including sputum collection)."
PMC3036630,S10,,"AHR to mannitol was expressed as response-dose-ratio (RDR) and related to cell counts, ECP, MPO and IL-8 levels in sputum."
PMC3036630,S11,,Results
PMC3036630,S12,,"There was a positive correlation between RDR to mannitol and eosinophil numbers (r = 0.47, p = 0.03) and level of IL-8 (r = 0.46, p = 0.04) in hypertonic saline-induced sputum."
PMC3036630,S13,,"Furthermore, significant correlations were found between RDR and eosinophil numbers (r = 0.71, p = 0.001), level of ECP (r = 0.72, p = 0.001), IL-8 (r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and MPO (r = 0.64, p = 0.007) in sputum collected after mannitol challenge."
PMC3036630,S14,,ROC-curves showed 60% sensitivity and 100% specificity of RDR for >2.5% eosinophils in mannitol-induced sputum.
PMC3036630,S15,,Conclusions
PMC3036630,S16,,In mild-moderate COPD mannitol hyperresponsiveness is associated with biomarkers of airway inflammation.
PMC3036630,S17,,"The high specificity of mannitol challenge suggests that the test is particularly suitable to exclude eosinophilic airways inflammation, which may facilitate individualized treatment in COPD."

PMC3036630,S22,,Airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gasses.
PMC3036630,S23,,The treatment options in COPD are still limited and current efforts focus on therapy targeted to particular phenotypes of the disease[1].
PMC3036630,S24,,"A non-invasive, standardised way to measure and monitor airway inflammation in COPD is hypertonic saline-induced sputum[2]."
PMC3036630,S25,,"Analysis of induced sputum provides information about cell counts (eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages) and cell activity by mediator concentrations (e.g. ECP, MPO and IL-8)."
PMC3036630,S26,,In COPD patients the identification of sputum eosinophilia has shown to be of clinical value as it predicts a response to corticosteroids[3-5].
PMC3036630,S27,,"Furthermore, guiding inhaled steroid therapy by sputum eosinophil counts leads to a reduction in exacerbations in COPD, without an increase in steroid dose[6]."
PMC3036630,S28,,These observations demonstrate the value of identifying inflammatory subphenotypes in the treatment of COPD.
PMC3036630,S29,,"However, the application of sputum analysis is somewhat limited by the requirement of lab facilities and the not-directly available results."
PMC3036630,S30,,"Therefore, there is a need for adequate surrogate markers of airway inflammation in COPD."
PMC3036630,S31,,"Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) may serve as a surrogate measure of airway inflammation, since it is associated with the presence of inflammatory cells and release of mediators in the airways[7]."
PMC3036630,S32,,"In particular, this holds for indirect challenges, amongst which dry powder mannitol challenge is relatively easy to apply[8,9]."
PMC3036630,S33,,"Local mannitol deposition results in an osmotic change, likely to induce the release of mediators from inflammatory cells in the airways[10]."
PMC3036630,S34,,Studies in asthma showed that AHR to mannitol is indeed related to the degree of eosinophilic airway inflammation and is sensitive to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids[11-13].
PMC3036630,S35,,"Interestingly, a proof of concept study demonstrated that mannitol challenge might also be useful in identifying COPD patients who will most likely benefit from inhaled corticosteroids[14]."
PMC3036630,S36,,This may suggest that AHR to mannitol identifies the degree of eosinophilic inflammation in COPD.
PMC3036630,S37,,We postulated that AHR to mannitol captures eosinophilic airway inflammation in adults with mild to moderate COPD.
PMC3036630,S38,,"Our aim was to test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between AHR to mannitol and markers of inflammation in hypertonic saline-induced sputum, blood and exhaled air."
PMC3036630,S39,,"As secondary aim, we investigated whether similar relations can be observed when using spontaneously produced sputum during or directly after the mannitol challenge itself."
PMC3036630,S40,,"Finally, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using AHR against sputum eosinophilia in COPD."

PMC3036630,S123,,Discussion
PMC3036630,S124,,"In this group of mild to moderate COPD patients, AHR to inhaled mannitol was consistently associated with eosinophil counts in hypertonic saline- as well as mannitol-induced sputum."
PMC3036630,S125,,"In addition, we observed associations between AHR to mannitol and soluble markers of inflammation in sputum."
PMC3036630,S126,,"Our results suggest that mannitol challenge identifies inflammatory subphenotypes in COPD, in particular those patients without eosinophilic inflammation due to the high specificity of the test."
PMC3036630,S127,,This may facilitate individualized treatment in COPD.
PMC3036630,S128,,"To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the relationship between airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol and markers of airway inflammation in sputum and exhaled air in patients with COPD."
PMC3036630,S129,,"These observations extend previous findings in COPD using adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), in which a correlation between AHR to AMP and eosinophils in sputum was observed[24]."
PMC3036630,S130,,"Interestingly, a similar correlation between RDR to mannitol and sputum eosinophils was recently reported in patients with asthma, also showing absence of eosinophilia in patients without mannitol hyperresponsiveness[13]."
PMC3036630,S131,,"Hence, mannitol challenge appears to provide valuable information on the inflammatory profile in both patients with COPD and asthma."
PMC3036630,S132,,"In our study, particular attention was paid to methodological aspects such as selection of COPD patients, design and methods."
PMC3036630,S133,,"The patients were derived from a clinical population rather than an epidemiological one, in order to strengthen the applicability of our findings."
PMC3036630,S134,,All patients were well characterised by using subjective and objective criteria.
PMC3036630,S135,,"This included the presence of symptoms, fixed airway obstruction and smoking history."
PMC3036630,S136,,"The full range in sputum eosinophils counts was 0.1 to 7.4%, which is similar to previous studies in COPD[3-5]."
PMC3036630,S137,,"To exclude any confounding effects of inhaled corticosteroids on mannitol challenge, the patients who used inhaled corticosteroids stopped this medication for 4 weeks[9,11]."
PMC3036630,S138,,"In order to answer the research question accurately, we performed mannitol challenge and sputum induction on separate days."
PMC3036630,S139,,"In addition, we examined sputum expectorated after the mannitol itself, which confirmed our results."
PMC3036630,S140,,"Furthermore, as inflammatory markers we used both, the presence of inflammatory cells and markers of cell activation."
PMC3036630,S141,,This provided consistent associations.
PMC3036630,S142,,"Nevertheless, our study has limitations."
PMC3036630,S143,,"First, we could not obtain adequate sputum samples in all patients at all time points."
PMC3036630,S144,,"Even though the power of the study was adequate to address the primary objectives, it may not have been adequate to examine our secondary objective."
PMC3036630,S145,,"Second, we can not exclude that our COPD group included patients who also had asthma."
PMC3036630,S146,,"We excluded those with a previous history of asthma, but this may not have sufficed."
PMC3036630,S147,,"However, all patients had a smoking history, fixed airflow limitation, met the COPD GOLD criteria, and were diagnosed and treated as COPD patients."
PMC3036630,S148,,"Third, the patients needed to stop the inhaled corticosteroids in order to examine unbiased disease markers."
PMC3036630,S149,,"Therefore, the test performance cannot be generalized to COPD patients on inhaled steroids."
PMC3036630,S150,,This will require a separate study.
PMC3036630,S151,,"Finally, we did not include a second mannitol challenge for examining reproducibility of our results, which is a limitation of our design."
PMC3036630,S152,,How can we interpret these results?
PMC3036630,S153,,"Mannitol is an osmotic stimulus that causes airway narrowing by release of bronchoconstrictor mediators such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins and histamine[25,26]."
PMC3036630,S154,,"The source of these mediators is likely to be mast cells and eosinophils in the airways as both these cell types release mediators in vitro in response to mannitol[10,11,27]."
PMC3036630,S155,,Mast cells and eosinophils are not unimportant in COPD and may contribute to the fluctuations of airways obstruction as observed e.g. during exacerbations[28-31].
PMC3036630,S156,,"We did not observe associations of mannitol responsiveness with neutrophil counts in sputum or blood, but did found significant correlations with sputum IL-8 and MPO."
PMC3036630,S157,,This may suggest that epithelial cell and neutrophil activity are also involved in determining the airway narrowing to inhaled mannitol in COPD.
PMC3036630,S158,,"Interestingly, mannitol responsiveness was more strongly associated with FeNO than with sputum eosinophils."
PMC3036630,S159,,"However, we did not find a significant association between the latter two parameters."
PMC3036630,S160,,This is in keeping with the data by Siva et al. [6].
PMC3036630,S161,,Our results suggest that mannitol responsiveness is a better marker of eosinophilic inflammation than FeNO in COPD.
PMC3036630,S162,,"Notably, we observed that most COPD patients produced adequate sputum samples during the mannitol challenge."
PMC3036630,S163,,This occurred even in absence of encouraging the patients to expectorate.
PMC3036630,S164,,"Therefore, the success rate of obtaining mannitol-induced sputum may well be improved by adjusting the standard operating procedure of the test."
PMC3036630,S165,,"Our findings extend a recent study in asthma, showing adequate sputum samples after mannitol challenge[32]."
PMC3036630,S166,,"Inhaled mannitol changes osmolarity and reduces viscoelasticity, surface tension, contact angle and the solids content of sputum[33]."
PMC3036630,S167,,This may explain why 75% of the patients gave up sputum during mannitol challenge.
PMC3036630,S168,,"Our results suggest that mannitol activated eosinophils, neutrophils and epithelial cells."
PMC3036630,S169,,"Hence, even though AHR to mannitol was associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation, it is likely to be a more pleiotropic stimulus within the airways."
PMC3036630,S170,,What are the clinical implications of our study?
PMC3036630,S171,,"Eosinophilic airway inflammation predicts the response of COPD patients to systemic and inhaled corticosteroids[4,5]."
PMC3036630,S172,,"In addition, inhaled steroid therapy guided by sputum eosinophils reduces exacerbation rate in patients with COPD[6]."
PMC3036630,S173,,"Our results suggest that mannitol challenge can identify COPD patients without eosinophilic airway inflammation, who not likely to benefit from inhaled steroid therapy[6]."
PMC3036630,S174,,This subphenotype of patients cannot be distinguished from other patients with COPD on clinical grounds or lung function criteria.
PMC3036630,S175,,"Therefore, mannitol challenge may qualify as a feasible alternative in the monitoring of anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD."
PMC3036630,S176,,The high specificity (100%) in combination with limited sensitivity indicates that mannitol responsiveness is particularly suitable to exclude sputum eosinophilia in COPD.
PMC3036630,S177,,"Indeed, inhaled steroids appear to be ineffective in COPD patients with the lowest responsiveness to mannitol[14]."
PMC3036630,S178,,"Therefore, mannitol responsiveness may support decisions to refrain from inhaled steroid treatment, thereby potentially preventing overtreatment of COPD."
PMC3036630,S179,,This requires a randomized controlled study in COPD comparing a treatment strategy based on AHR to mannitol with the currently recommended treatment strategy based on clinical markers only.
PMC3036630,S180,,"It remains to be established whether mannitol challenge can also be an outcome measure of the efficacy of steroids in COPD, as has been shown in asthma[12]."
PMC3036630,S181,,"Finally, our data suggest that the assessment of AHR and airway inflammation in COPD can be combined in a single test."
PMC3036630,S182,,"This would have large practical advantages, not only in clinical research, but also regarding the guidance and monitoring of anti-inflammatory therapy in clinical practice."
PMC3036630,S183,,Conclusions
PMC3036630,S184,,We conclude that airway responsiveness to mannitol can be used to rule out eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with mild to moderate COPD who are not treated with inhaled corticosteroids.
PMC3036630,S185,,"These finding suggests that mannitol challenge is a candidate for the guidance and monitoring of individualized, anti-inflammatory therapy in COPD, as an alternative to sputum eosinophils."

PMC3070271,S5,,To assess the efficacy of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist anakinra in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).
PMC3070271,S6,,Methods
PMC3070271,S7,,"A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted."
PMC3070271,S8,,"The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of a 1-month treatment with anakinra (2 mg/kg subcutaneous daily, maximum 100 mg) with a placebo between two groups each with 12 patients with SJIA."
PMC3070271,S9,,"Response was defined by a 30% improvement of the paediatric American College of Rheumatology criteria for JIA, resolution of systemic symptoms and a decrease of at least 50% of both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with baseline."

PMC3070271,S22,,Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a disease of unknown aetiology characterised by arthritis and systemic symptoms starting before the age of 16.1

PMC3070271,S28,,"In particular, serum samples from patients with SJIA induce IL-1Î_ transcription on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra leads to the normalisation of a disease-specific gene expression profile.6 7"

PMC3070271,S154,,Nine out of 10 patients from group 2 who switched to anakinra at M1 responded at M2.
PMC3070271,S155,,"PK analyses revealed a trend towards lower anakinra concentrations at M2 and M6 in patients with lower weight and those who had failed to respond to anakinra after 1 month (residual anakinra concentration of 45.5 Â± 51 ng/ml (range 20â€“122) vs 136.5 Â± 106 ng/ml (range 20â€“353) in responders), but overall this difference was not significant."
PMC3070271,S156,,"The dose of predniso(lo)ne had been reduced after the M1 visit in accordance with the protocol recommendations in all the responders who continued the trial (eight patients, all from group 1) and in seven other patients (four patients from group 1 and three patients from group 2) who had shown some improvement (investigator's decision)."
PMC3070271,S157,,Three responders from group 1 in whom the dose of corticosteroids had been reduced were not responders at M2 anymore.
PMC3070271,S158,,The dose of corticosteroids was then either maintained stable or reduced in accordance with the protocol recommendations at each visit (supplementary table S4).
PMC3070271,S159,,Seventeen patients continued the trial until M6.
PMC3070271,S160,,"Their mean daily dose of predniso(lo)ne was 0.18 mg/kg (median 0.16, range 0â€“0.58); the six responders at M6 had a daily prednisone dose of <10 mg or 0.3 mg/kg."
PMC3070271,S161,,"These six patients, whose mean predniso(lo)ne dose at enrolment was 0.51 mg/kg (SD 0.32), were all responders to 1 month of anakinra treatment and had already achieved ACRpedi 50 or 70 improvement at this stage."

PMC3070271,S165,,Four infections and one vertebral collapse had a favourable outcome and these five patients continued the trial; one patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease shortly after M2 and withdrawn from the trial.
PMC3070271,S166,,"This patient initially belong to group 1; he was a non-responder at M1; however, minor improvement had led the treating doctor to start tapering the dose of prednisone at this stage."
PMC3070271,S167,,Other AEs mainly consisted of non-severe injection-site reactions and common infections (table 3).

PMC3070271,S172,,Expression of more than 500 transcripts changed significantly in the six patients who responded to anakinra at M6 (supplementary table S5).
PMC3070271,S173,,"The modular analysis of responders at M6 (n=6) showed the normalisation of 11/13 original modular alterations, while non-responders still showed altered expression of 12 of them (figure 3A)."
PMC3070271,S174,,"Interestingly, overexpression of type I IFN-inducible genes (module 3.1) was observed in every group after initiation of anakinra treatment (both at M1 and M6) regardless of the clinical response (figure 3B)."
PMC3070271,S175,,"To support the validity of the transcriptional data, we measured the protein levels of two IFN-inducible proteins (IP10 and TRAIL) and found that they were significantly increased in the serum of anakinra-treated patients at M6 (figure 3C)."
PMC3070271,S176,,"Accordingly, SOCS3 expression, which could explain the cross-regulation of IL-1Î_ and type I IFN, was downregulated in the majority of patients at M6 (figure 3D)."
PMC3070271,S177,,Discussion
PMC3070271,S178,,"This double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy of anakinra in treating corticosteroid-dependent patients with SJIA, as a significantly higher proportion of responders was observed after 1 month of treatment compared with placebo."
PMC3070271,S179,,"However, a loss of response was observed in most patients over time."
PMC3070271,S180,,"The efficacy of anakinra treatment in SJIA, at least in the short term, concorded with previous reports.6 8â€“10"
PMC3070271,S181,,"However, the only other placebo-controlled trial testing anakinra in JIA showed no significant improvement versus placebo,18 illustrating that marked response to IL-1 inhibition is not characteristic of all JIA subtypes."
PMC3070271,S182,,The lack of sustained response in several patients may have been related to several factors.
PMC3070271,S183,,"First, most patients had diffuse polyarthritis at enrolment but no fever; as previously reported,9 anakinra seemed less effective on the arthritis than on systemic features."
PMC3070271,S184,,"Second, PK data suggested that low-weight children might have benefited from a higher anakinra dosage."
PMC3070271,S185,,"Third, we included patients with active SJIA, steroid-dependency and a minimal disease duration of 6 months, therefore difficult to treat5; loss of responses may have been favoured by the study design that precluded the use of associated DMARDs and allowed tapering of the corticosteroid dose at an early stage, a strategy designed to minimise the risk of treatment-related complications."
PMC3070271,S186,,This study has limitations owing to the small number of patients and the short duration of the double-blind phase.
PMC3070271,S187,,"In particular, we were unable to properly assess which patients' characteristics might predict response to treatment."
PMC3070271,S188,,"In recent reports, the absence of small joint involvement, a smaller number of joints with active disease and an increased absolute neutrophil count were reported to be predictive of response to anakinra.9 10"
PMC3070271,S189,,No severe infections occurred in this trial and anti-pneumococcal Ab response was not affected by anakinra treatment.
PMC3070271,S190,,"However, severe infections have been reported under anakinra in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.19"
PMC3070271,S191,,"One patient here was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, a complication reported in some patients initially diagnosed with JIA and treated with anti-TNF agents.3 20 21"
PMC3070271,S192,,An additional patient experienced a sudden rise in serum transaminases.
PMC3070271,S193,,"In order to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of anakinra in SJIA, further studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up need to be implemented."
PMC3070271,S194,,"As expected, the ex vivo genomic analysis of patient blood at D1 showed upregulation of transcripts related to innate immunity and haematopoiesis (supplementary table S2)."
PMC3070271,S195,,"Although several hereditary and sporadic IL-1Î_-mediated diseases involve alterations in NLRP3 inflammasome components,22 no altered expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related transcripts was observed."
PMC3070271,S196,,"However, two different flagellin receptors (CARD12 and TLR5) were significantly upregulated in the majority of patients at D1 (supplementary table S2) and normalised in the responder group at M6 (supplementary table S5)."
PMC3070271,S197,,Whether the triggering of flagellin receptors is involved in the pathogenesis of SJIA remains to be elucidated.
PMC3070271,S198,,Alterations in the blood gene expression profiles of patients with SJIA at the time of randomisation were highly reproducible in the treatment and placebo groups.
PMC3070271,S199,,This was best visualised using a strategy based on the analysis of modules composed of transcriptionally co-regulated genes.14
PMC3070271,S200,,Longitudinal changes correlating with disease resolution were found upon follow-up.
PMC3070271,S201,,"Changes probably induced by treatment, regardless of clinical response, were also identified."
PMC3070271,S202,,"Strikingly, an upregulation of type I IFN-regulated transcripts, which is not a feature of untreated SJIA,7 23â€“25 was induced in the majority of anakinra-treated patients at M1 and M6."
PMC3070271,S203,,"Accordingly, two IFN-inducible proteins were also significantly upregulated in the serum samples of patients at M6."
PMC3070271,S204,,The molecular and cellular basis for an IL-1 Î_/type I IFN cross-regulation in SJIA remains unknown.
PMC3070271,S205,,"Inhibition of type I IFN signalling by IL-1Î_ might occur through the induction of SOCS3, which is a negative regulator of IL-1-dependent acute inflammatory arthritis and osteoclast generation.26 27"
PMC3070271,S206,,"Conversely, type I IFN decreases IL-1Î_ and induces IL-1Ra production by PBMCs in vitro.28"
PMC3070271,S207,,A similar cross-regulation has been described for type I IFN and TNFÎ±.
PMC3070271,S208,,"Thus, patients with SJIA treated with TNF antagonists develop a blood IFN signature.29"
PMC3070271,S209,,"Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease treated with TNF antagonists develop anti-nuclear Abs and some of them display symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, a type I IFN-mediated disease.29"
PMC3070271,S210,,Whether the upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes in anakinra-treated patients could have clinical consequences through the triggering of adaptive immunity remains to be determined.
PMC3070271,S211,,"In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with SJIA responded to IL-1 blockade as dramatically as patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, confirming a key role for IL-1 in a wide spectrum of diseases.30"

PMC3076731,S19,,Introduction
PMC3076731,S20,,Turnerâ€™s syndrome can be defined as absence or abnormality of the second X chromosome in a major cell line in a phenotypic female.
PMC3076731,S21,,"The phenotype is highly variable, but short stature and gonadal dysgenesis are usually present."
PMC3076731,S22,,"Short stature in Turnerâ€™s syndrome relates to impairment of each phase of the infancy-childhood-puberty model of growth,1 and it results in a mean untreated final height approximately 21 cm below that of the unaffected female population.2"
PMC3076731,S23,,"The mainstay of treatment for short stature is recombinant growth hormone, available since 1985 and licensed for use in Turnerâ€™s syndrome."
PMC3076731,S24,,"Studies have shown its efficacy in improving height velocity and final height, although individual outcomes vary markedly.3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
PMC3076731,S25,,The adjunctive use in Turnerâ€™s syndrome of the anabolic steroid oxandrolone remains controversial.
PMC3076731,S26,,"When given in combination with growth hormone treatment, some studies have reported improved final height,6 11 12 whereas others have reported little or no effect.13 14 15"
PMC3076731,S27,,"The high doses used in early studies were associated with virilisation,6 12 14 and even low doses, as reported in a recent Dutch publication, may be problematic.15"
PMC3076731,S28,,These potential adverse effects must be balanced against potential improvement in growth.
PMC3076731,S29,,Most girls with Turnerâ€™s syndrome need oestrogen therapy during adolescence to induce pubertal development.16
PMC3076731,S30,,"However, the optimal age at which to begin remains controversial; some people advocate a delay to extend the growth period and increase final height,5 6 17 18 whereas others have highlighted psychological problems of delaying pubertal development, suggesting that the benefits are marginal.19"
PMC3076731,S31,,The British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes recognised the uncertainties relating to the use of oxandrolone and timing of pubertal induction and set up the UK Turner Study in 1999 to investigate them.

PMC3076731,S106,,"The mean effect on final height of oxandrolone, late induction of puberty, or both compared with placebo and early induction was +7.1 cm (that is, the mean final height in the combined oxandrolone/early, oxandrolone/late, and placebo/late groups compared with the placebo/early group), which is appreciably larger than the effects for either randomisation alone (table 3, combination)."
PMC3076731,S107,,"This was because the randomisation analyses compared intervention and control groups in which half of each control group had received an effective intervention from the other randomisation, thus reducing the apparent effect size."
PMC3076731,S108,,"The standard deviation for the combined group was 5.1 cm, rather less than the 7.4 cm for the placebo/early induction group (P=0.1), suggesting that treatment preferentially benefited the shortest girls."
PMC3076731,S109,,"Table 3 also includes the results for maximum height, based on the 92 girls still in the trial."
PMC3076731,S110,,"The oxandrolone effect of +4.3 cm (P=0.002) was similar to that for final height (+4.6 cm), and the late induction effect of +2.4 cm (P=0.2) was appreciably smaller than the +3.8 cm for final height."
PMC3076731,S111,,"The age of attainment of final height was similar for oxandrolone and placebo (16.2 v 16.7 years; P=0.1) and later, by design, for late versus early induction (16.9 v 16.1 years; P=0.009)."
PMC3076731,S112,,SITAR analysis of height curves
PMC3076731,S113,,We applied the SITAR analysis to the 105 participants with at least one height measurement (one girl in the control group withdrew immediately after randomisation 1).

PMC3076731,S117,,"The SITAR adjustment process estimated the size, tempo, and velocity parameters for each participant, which when applied to their curves made them all very similar, with a residual standard deviation of 0.6 mm around the summary curve (fig 2, bottom panel)."
PMC3076731,S118,,"Comparison of the mean values of the parameters by trial arm showed differences in size (oxandrolone v placebo +2.6 cm; P=0.02) but not tempo (âˆ’0.3 years; P=0.1), and the mean velocity was dramatically greater for oxandrolone (difference +23%, SE 4%; P<0.001)."
PMC3076731,S119,,"This indicated that the developmental age scale in the oxandrolone arm was foreshortened by 23%, increasing the velocity and making the oxandrolone curve correspondingly steeper than the placebo curve, although the age of final height was no earlier."
PMC3076731,S120,,"This effect is seen in figure 3 (top panel), which shows SITAR summary curves calculated separately for oxandrolone and placebo."
PMC3076731,S121,,"The two curves cross at 10 years, and height velocity is consistently greater in the oxandrolone arm."

PMC3076731,S124,,"The differences here were smaller, the curves diverging only after 14 years; the late versus early comparisons for size (+2.2 cm) and velocity (âˆ’9%) were statistically insignificant (P>0.1), whereas tempo was slightly delayed in the late induction arm (+0.4 years; P=0.06)."
PMC3076731,S125,,Adverse events
PMC3076731,S126,,"Between 1999 and 2009, 197 adverse events were reported; none of them were suspected to be unexpected serious adverse reactions."
PMC3076731,S127,,"Ten were classified as serious adverse events, as they involved admission to hospital for procedures including appendicectomy and ear, nose, and throat surgery (for example, grommet (ventilation tube) insertion)."
PMC3076731,S128,,"Four adverse events could have been related to oxandrolone or ethinylestradiol: acne in a 15 year old (all study drugs were continued, and randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 14 years); persistent hypertension in a 13 year old (oxandrolone/placebo was stopped and antihypertensive treatment started, blood pressure normalised, and oxandrolone/placebo treatment was restarted; the randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 12 years); abnormal liver function in a 16 year old (the participant was at near final height and elected to stop growth promoting treatment; randomisation was later revealed as oxandrolone and pubertal induction at 14 years); and episodic â€œhot flushesâ€ù in a 15 year old (all study drugs were continued; randomisation was later revealed as placebo and pubertal induction at 14 years)."
PMC3076731,S129,,"No virilisation was reported; in particular, no voice deepening or clitoromegaly was noted."
PMC3076731,S130,,Discussion
PMC3076731,S131,,This randomised controlled trial of growth promoting treatment in Turnerâ€™s syndrome showed a clear benefit to final height of oxandrolone treatment and of introducing ethinylestradiol for pubertal induction at age 14 rather than 12 years.
PMC3076731,S132,,Comparison with other studies
PMC3076731,S133,,This positive effect of oxandrolone on final height compares favourably with previous studies.5 6 11 12
PMC3076731,S134,,"Early studies using high doses of oxandrolone had to reduce or stop treatment after reports of virilisation,6 12 and others showed little or no effect of oxandrolone.13 14"
PMC3076731,S135,,"However, they were retrospective in design and varied in treatment protocol."
PMC3076731,S136,,"In contrast, the UK Turner Study used a prospective placebo controlled design, with consistent doses of oxandrolone throughout."
PMC3076731,S137,,"A recent Dutch trial comparing growth hormone with two doses of oxandrolone (0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg/day) reported that the lower dose significantly increased adult â€œheight gainâ€ù compared with placebo, whereas the higher dose did not.15"
PMC3076731,S138,,"In contrast, the final height in both oxandrolone groups was only approximately 1 cm greater than placebo (156.7 cm and 156.5 cm versus 155.6 cm)."
PMC3076731,S139,,"The more favourable outcome in the UK study could be related to earlier age at starting growth hormone therapy (6.4 v ~9 years) and also to the lower doses of oxandrolone given in the UK study (0.05 mg/kg/day, maximum 2.5 mg daily) compared with the 0.06 mg/kg/day arm of the Dutch study."
PMC3076731,S140,,"No adverse events directly attributable to oxandrolone were reported in the UK Turner Study; in particular, no virilisation was reported."
PMC3076731,S141,,"Although oxandrolone could have contributed to the cases of acne, hypertension, and abnormal liver function, causality cannot be assumed as these are commonly seen in Turnerâ€™s syndrome.25 26"
PMC3076731,S142,,"By contrast, the Dutch study reported virilisation in 15/36 girls receiving 0.06 mg/kg/day, which was severe enough for treatment to be discontinued in seven."
PMC3076731,S143,,"However, patients receiving placebo also reported virilisation, and how these events were assessed is unclear.15"
PMC3076731,S144,,"Furthermore, the maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg used in the UK study irrespective of body weight could account for the absence of reported virilisation."
PMC3076731,S145,,"The UK Turner Study has also shown a positive effect on final height of introducing ethinylestradiol at age 14 rather than 12 years, consistent with the effect of oestrogen on epiphyseal fusion and supporting previous published associations between delayed pubertal induction and increased height.6 13 18"
PMC3076731,S146,,"Since 1999, however, concern has been expressed about the potential cardiovascular, skeletal, reproductive, and psychological consequences of prolonged oestrogen deficiency.19 27 28 29"
PMC3076731,S147,,The finding that oxandrolone allows timely pubertal induction is thus attractive and in keeping with other work.30 31 32 33 34
PMC3076731,S148,,This study shows that oxandrolone increases height velocity throughout the growing period yet does not materially advance the age of final height.
PMC3076731,S149,,"However, whereas both oxandrolone and late induction have been shown to increase final height, the two effects were not additive, so that giving either is beneficial but giving both is no better."
PMC3076731,S150,,One possible explanation for this is that there is a â€œceilingâ€ù for the extra height available from growth promoting strategies in Turnerâ€™s syndrome.
PMC3076731,S151,,"The subset of participants who were randomised twice and received oxandrolone had a larger â€œgainâ€ù in final height than did those who did not need any oestrogen treatment, whether they received oxandrolone or not."
PMC3076731,S152,,"The numbers were too small to allow more detailed analysis, but we speculate that the girls who showed spontaneous puberty would have fused their epiphyses earlier than the other girls, which may have resulted in a less favourable final height."
PMC3076731,S153,,Strengths and limitations of study
PMC3076731,S154,,This randomised controlled trial has examined a large cohort of patients treated systematically over a 10 year period.
PMC3076731,S155,,"Treatment has been well tolerated, such that dropout rates were low (14/106) and the mean final height for the group to date (151.8 cm) is well above the target of 150 cm for girls with Turnerâ€™s syndrome treated with growth hormone.6 35 36"
PMC3076731,S156,,The number of girls who had completed the study and achieved final height at the time of analysis (n=82) fell short of the target sample size of 100.
PMC3076731,S157,,"Even when the remaining girls complete the study, the number evaluable at final height will still only be 92."
PMC3076731,S158,,"Despite this, however, the group of 82 girls has been sufficient to show positive effects of oxandrolone and delayed pubertal induction, and the addition of the 10 girls yet to complete is unlikely to materially alter the outcome."
PMC3076731,S159,,"However, the failure to achieve the target sample size may have limited the ability to detect an interaction between the two randomisations."
PMC3076731,S160,,"Unfortunately, the break in production of oxandrolone 2.5 mg tablets twice led to deviations from the protocol."
PMC3076731,S161,,"Placebo tablets were unavailable for other oxandrolone preparations, and eventually the difficulties in supply led to the early termination of the treatment arm."
PMC3076731,S162,,"Therefore, the results may underestimate the true effect of oxandrolone."
PMC3076731,S163,,"Even so, they make a strong case for reintroduction of oxandrolone manufacture in Europe or, failing that, affordable importation, as costs of supplies from elsewhere are prohibitive."
PMC3076731,S164,,Girls with mosaic Turnerâ€™s karyotypes were included in the study.
PMC3076731,S165,,"With a larger sample size, the effect of different karyotypes, with varying haploinsufficiency of the SHOX region, on height outcome could be examined."
PMC3076731,S166,,"However, the group sizes of those who were randomised twice and attained final height were too small to allow further breakdown by karyotype."
PMC3076731,S167,,A measure of bone mineral density was not included in the study protocol and would have provided valuable information.
PMC3076731,S168,,"Although its value is now recognised in this patient group, the necessary scanning equipment was not routinely available at all participating centres when the study started."
PMC3076731,S169,,Conclusions and policy implications
PMC3076731,S170,,"Oxandrolone has a positive effect on final height, as has inducing puberty at age 14 rather than 12 years."
PMC3076731,S171,,"However, doing both offers no added benefit."
PMC3076731,S172,,"We recommend, therefore, that when growth promotion is being considered in girls with Turnerâ€™s syndrome, families are offered oxandrolone as an alternative to late pubertal induction."
PMC3076731,S173,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3076731,S174,,Growth hormone treatment improves growth and stature in girls with Turnerâ€™s syndrome
PMC3076731,S175,,"However, the adjunctive use of the anabolic steroid oxandrolone remains controversial, with inconsistent reports of effect on growth and virilising side effects"
PMC3076731,S176,,"Most girls with Turnerâ€™s syndrome need oestrogen therapy for pubertal induction, but the optimal age at which to begin treatment and its subsequent effect on growth have yet to be established"

PMC3103669,S3,,Abstract
PMC3103669,S4,,Objective
PMC3103669,S5,,"This study assessed the efficacy and safety of canakinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin 1Î_ monoclonal antibody, for prophylaxis against acute gouty arthritis flares in patients initiating urate-lowering treatment."
PMC3103669,S6,,Methods
PMC3103669,S7,,"In this double-blind, double-dummy, dose-ranging study, 432 patients with gouty arthritis initiating allopurinol treatment were randomised 1:1:1:1:1:1:2 to receive: a single dose of canakinumab, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg subcutaneously; 4Ã—4-weekly doses of canakinumab (50+50+25+25 mg subcutaneously); or daily colchicine 0.5 mg orally for 16 weeks."
PMC3103669,S8,,Patients recorded details of flares in diaries.
PMC3103669,S9,,The study aimed to determine the canakinumab dose having equivalent efficacy to colchicine 0.5 mg at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669,S10,,Results
PMC3103669,S11,,A dose-response for canakinumab was not apparent with any of the four predefined dose-response models.
PMC3103669,S12,,The estimated canakinumab dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of doses tested.
PMC3103669,S13,,"At 16 weeks, there was a 62% to 72% reduction in the mean number of flares per patient for canakinumab doses â‰¥50 mg versus colchicine based on a negative binomial model (rate ratio: 0.28â€“0.38, pâ‰_0.0083), and the percentage of patients experiencing â‰¥1 flare was significantly lower for all canakinumab doses (15% to 27%) versus colchicine (44%, p<0.05)."

PMC3103669,S18,,Introduction
PMC3103669,S19,,"Gouty arthritis is a painful inflammatory arthritis that becomes increasingly prevalent with age, affecting around 10% of men and 6% of women over 70 years old.1 2"
PMC3103669,S20,,"It results from deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints, which leads to painful inflammatory acute gouty arthritis flares.3 4"
PMC3103669,S21,,An increasing number of patients have comorbidities which make standard therapies inappropriate.5
PMC3103669,S22,,"Such patients may develop difficult-to-treat disease, characterised by frequent flares and persistent inflammation between flares which contribute to joint damage6 and have a major impact on health-related quality of life7 8 and an individual's ability to work.9"
PMC3103669,S23,,Long-standing elevated body uric acid pools can lead to increased serum urate (SU) levels and formation of MSU crystals.
PMC3103669,S24,,"An important goal in the long-term management of gouty arthritis is the reduction of SU levels to below 6 mg/dl so as to prevent formation of new crystals, dissolve existing crystals and ultimately decrease the incidence of flares.10 11"
PMC3103669,S25,,This is achieved with urate lowering therapies (ULT).12
PMC3103669,S26,,Allopurinol is the most commonly used ULT and the current standard of care.
PMC3103669,S27,,"During the first weeks and months after initiating ULT, rapid reductions in SU levels can induce acute gouty arthritis flares.13â€“17"
PMC3103669,S28,,"Therefore, when initiating a patient on ULT, prophylactic low-dose anti-inflammatory treatment is recommended to prevent flares and foster compliance with ULT."
PMC3103669,S29,,"Low-dose colchicine is the most commonly prescribed drug for prophylaxis in patients initiating ULT, but it has significant shortcomings."
PMC3103669,S30,,Some patients have contraindications to colchicine whereas others do not tolerate colchicine or still experience flares.
PMC3103669,S31,,Evidence for the efficacy of colchicine as prophylaxis against flares comes from two small studies and a larger study performed 50 years ago.18â€“20
PMC3103669,S32,,"Three recent trials used colchicine for prophylaxis in patients initiating ULT (with febuxostat), but provide limited data on the efficacy of colchicine.17 21 22"
PMC3103669,S33,,There is therefore a need for more rigorous assessment of the efficacy of colchicine as prophylaxis against flares following ULT initiation and the introduction of alternative therapies.
PMC3103669,S34,,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1Î_ (IL-1Î_), plays a key role in mediating the initiation of inflammation in gouty arthritis in a similar manner to that occurring in the hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS),23 24 and may also contribute to joint destruction in gouty arthritis.6 25 26"
PMC3103669,S35,,"This suggests that selective blockade of IL-1Î_ signalling may provide effective prophylaxis against flares in patients with gouty arthritis and is supported by results showing that IL-1Î_ blockade with canakinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-1Î_ with a half-life of 3â€“4 weeks,27 can effectively reduce pain, inflammation and the risk of recurrent flares in patients with acute gouty arthritis.28"

PMC3103669,S81,,Primary outcome: determination of canakinumab target dose
PMC3103669,S82,,No evidence of a dose-response was seen in any of the four predefined dose response models.
PMC3103669,S83,,The estimated canakinumab dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of canakinumab doses tested.
PMC3103669,S84,,Secondary outcomes
PMC3103669,S85,,Clinical outcomes
PMC3103669,S86,,"The least-squares (LS) mean number of flares per patient for the 16 weeks (according to the preplanned ANCOVA) was lower for all canakinumab doses compared with colchicine 0.5 mg; differences were statistically significant for the canakinumab 100 mg and 300 mg doses (pâ‰_0.05, table 2)."
PMC3103669,S87,,"(The LS mean number of flares per patient is the best-fitting unbiased estimate calculated from the ANCOVA model.) However, as the distribution of flares per patient was observed to be skewed (most patients had no or few flares and few had many flares), the preplanned ANCOVA was considered inappropriate for these data."
PMC3103669,S88,,Therefore a post hoc analysis using a negative binomial model (the model used for the primary outcome) was performed after unblinding at 16 weeks.
PMC3103669,S89,,"According to this analysis, there was a 62% to 72% reduction in the mean number of flares per patient for canakinumab doses â‰¥50 mg versus colchicine (rate ratio: 0.28â€“0.38, pâ‰_0.0083) (table 2)."

PMC3103669,S91,,"The percentage of patients experiencing at least one flare in the 16-week period was lower for all canakinumab groups versus colchicine 0.5 mg (canakinumab, 15% to 27%; colchicine, 44%, pâ‰_0.05), and all patients receiving canakinumab were significantly less likely to experience at least one flare compared with patients treated with colchicine (estimated odds ratio (OR) vs colchicine: 0.22â€“0.47, pâ‰_0.05) (table 2)."
PMC3103669,S92,,"In addition, time to first new gouty arthritis flare was longer with all canakinumab groups compared with colchicine 0.5 mg (figure 2) and there was a 64% to 72% reduction in the risk of experiencing at least one flare for canakinumab doses â‰¥50 mg versus colchicine at 16 weeks (HR: 0.28â€“0.36, pâ‰_0.05) (table 2)."
PMC3103669,S93,,The average duration (LS mean) for all flares over the 16-week period was shorter in all canakinumab groups compared with colchicine 0.5 mg: 2.8â€“4.6 days versus 5.1 days (table 2).

PMC3103669,S104,,Safety and tolerability
PMC3103669,S105,,Safety results for the individual dose groups are summarised in table 3.
PMC3103669,S106,,The incidence of AEs over the 24-week period was similar across the six canakinumab groups (51.9% to 58.5%) and for the colchicine group (53.7%) (table 3).
PMC3103669,S107,,"Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and there was no evidence of a dose-response for any AE."
PMC3103669,S108,,SAEs were reported in 14 (4.3%) patients treated with canakinumab and 6 (5.6%) patients treated with colchicine; 2 were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study medication: erysipelas of the left leg in the canakinumab 25 mg group and cancer of the right kidney in the colchicine group.
PMC3103669,S109,,"One death occurred in the colchicine group, a possible myocardial infarction, but was not regarded by the investigator as being related to study medication."
PMC3103669,S110,,"Five further patients discontinued due to SAEs (canakinumab, n=4 (1.2%); colchicine, n=1 (0.9%))."
PMC3103669,S111,,Infectious AEs were reported in 58 (18.0%) patients receiving canakinumab and 13 (12.0%) patients receiving colchicine 0.5 mg (table 3).
PMC3103669,S112,,There was no clear pattern with respect to the incidence of infections with either treatment.
PMC3103669,S113,,"The only infections occurring in more than 1% of patients receiving canakinumab were upper respiratory tract infections (3.7%), nasopharyngitis (3.7%) and influenza (1.2%)."
PMC3103669,S114,,Upper respiratory tract infections (3.7%) and cystitis (1.9%) were the only infections occurring in more than 1% of patients receiving colchicine.
PMC3103669,S115,,"Six serious infections (erysipelas, gangrene, sepsis, tonsillitis, ear infection and pneumonia) were reported in four patients receiving canakinumab (table 3)."
PMC3103669,S116,,Only the case of erysipelas was considered to be possibly related to study medication.
PMC3103669,S117,,No serious infections were reported in patients receiving colchicine.
PMC3103669,S118,,Injection-site reactions were reported in 20 (6.2%) patients treated with canakinumab and 4 (3.7%) patients in the colchicine group.
PMC3103669,S119,,All events were mild except for one moderate event in the canakinumab 50 mg group.
PMC3103669,S120,,One patient (in the 50 mg group) developed low levels of anti-canakinumab antibodies at week 24.
PMC3103669,S121,,Table 3 Adverse events (safety set)
PMC3103669,S122,,Discussion
PMC3103669,S123,,"This is the largest randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre trial reported in English in the medical literature to date assessing prophylaxis against acute gouty arthritis flares during the initiation of ULT."
PMC3103669,S124,,"We herein report that a single dose of canakinumab, 50â€“300 mg, or 4-weekly doses given over 4 months (two doses of 50 mg and two of 25 mg) produced a 62% to 72% reduction in the mean number of flares per patient and a 64% to 72% reduction in the risk of experiencing â‰¥1 flare at 16 weeks compared with colchicine."
PMC3103669,S125,,"In addition, the percentage of patients experiencing at least one flare at 16 weeks was significantly lower for all canakinumab doses compared with colchicine."
PMC3103669,S126,,"Target SU levels (<6 mg/dl) were achieved in 39% to 54% of patients treated with canakinumab and 46% of patients treated with colchicine at 16 weeks, consistent with results of other recent studies of allopurinol treatment in patients who were hyperuricaemic.17 21 22"
PMC3103669,S127,,All canakinumab doses were well tolerated.
PMC3103669,S128,,These results suggest that canakinumab can provide effective prophylaxis against gouty arthritis flares and is well tolerated in patients initiating ULT.
PMC3103669,S129,,The results of this study validate the concept that IL-1Î_ is a key mediator in the generation of acute gouty arthritis flares and hence an appropriate therapeutic target for treatment of acute gouty arthritis and prevention of flares.
PMC3103669,S130,,"This has previously been demonstrated in a phase II, dose-ranging study of canakinumab as treatment for acute flares in patients with difficult-to-treat gouty arthritis.28"
PMC3103669,S131,,"In this earlier study the highest dose of canakinumab tested, 150 mg, demonstrated consistently superior efficacy to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg across all efficacy measures assessed including pain reduction at 72 h post dose, time to a 50% reduction in pain and the risk of recurrent flares."
PMC3103669,S132,,"Therefore, the canakinumab 150 mg dose has been chosen for further assessment as treatment of acute gouty arthritis in phase III trials."
PMC3103669,S133,,"Rilonacept, another inhibitor of IL-1Î_ signalling in development, has demonstrated efficacy with weekly doses of 160 mg in the prevention of flares in patients initiating ULT compared with placebo,30 but has apparently failed to demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.31"
PMC3103669,S134,,The study reported here aimed to determine the dose of canakinumab for further study as prophylaxis for patients initiating ULT.
PMC3103669,S135,,"However, no dose-response was evident with respect to the primary endpoint and the estimated dose with equivalent efficacy to colchicine was below the range of canakinumab doses tested."
PMC3103669,S136,,Results of secondary outcomes indicated that single canakinumab doses of 50â€“300 mg or 4-weekly doses given over 4 months have similar efficacy across all clinical endpoints assessed and are superior to colchicine 0.5 mg.
PMC3103669,S137,,The results of this study suggest that canakinumab may provide effective prophylaxis against flares in patients initiating ULT when given at doses lower than those used to treat acute gouty arthritis flares.
PMC3103669,S138,,Accumulating data thus suggest that canakinumab is an effective new treatment option for patients with gouty arthritis and may be particularly valuable for patients with difficult-to-treat disease.
PMC3103669,S139,,Such patients frequently have comorbidities and may be unable to receive standard anti-inflammatory therapies.5
PMC3103669,S140,,Results of a recent phase II study in patients with contraindications to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or colchicine have shown that canakinumab 150 mg provided effective pain relief and reduced the risk of new flares.28
PMC3103669,S141,,This suggests that canakinumab is an effective treatment for acute gouty arthritis in patients with limited treatment options due to comorbidities.
PMC3103669,S142,,Ongoing phase III studies in this setting should help confirm the value of canakinumab for the treatment of this growing patient population who for whom improved treatment options are urgently required.
PMC3103669,S143,,Canakinumab was generally well tolerated.
PMC3103669,S144,,"Few patients experienced SAEs, severe AEs, or injection-site reactions."
PMC3103669,S145,,"No organ toxicity and no dose-response for any AE were observed, and only one SAE was reported that was considered possibly related to canakinumab treatment."
PMC3103669,S146,,"The safety profile of canakinumab reported here is consistent with that previously reported for treatment of acute gouty arthritis,28 and for patients with CAPS receiving canakinumab 150 mg at 8-week intervals for up to 48 weeks.32"
PMC3103669,S147,,Colchicine doses of 0.5â€“1.0 mg/day are recommended by The European League Against Rheumatism and the British Society for Rheumatology for prophylaxis against flares in patients initiating ULT.12 33
PMC3103669,S148,,In this study we used a colchicine dose of 0.5 mg/day.
PMC3103669,S149,,The choice of dose was based on the clinical experience of the investigators and results of a study indicating that a dose of 0.6 mg/day is better tolerated than a higher dose.18
PMC3103669,S150,,"In this particular study, the planned dose of colchicine prophylaxis was 0.6 mg twice daily.18"
PMC3103669,S151,,"However, dosing was reduced to once daily in approximately two-thirds of patients and 38% of patients experienced diarrhoea."
PMC3103669,S152,,"In three other recent studies in patients initiating ULT, a colchicine dose of 0.6 mg/day was employed as prophylaxis and significant rates of diarrhoea were not reported.17 21 22"
PMC3103669,S153,,The rates of flares reported in these studies during colchicine prophylaxis (10% to 15% per month) are comparable with those reported in our study for the colchicine group.
PMC3103669,S154,,There are a number of limitations to this study.
PMC3103669,S155,,"First, colchicine 0.5 mg was only given for 16 weeks."
PMC3103669,S156,,The risk of flares following initiation of ULT is known to extend for up to a year or longer; thus a more prolonged period of colchicine prophylaxis may have been appropriate.
PMC3103669,S157,,"However, key efficacy outcomes including the primary outcome were assessed at 16 weeks."
PMC3103669,S158,,"Second, occurrence and duration of flares was dependent on patientsâ€™ assessment."
PMC3103669,S159,,This reflects the fact that there are currently no validated endpoints for the assessment of gouty arthritis flares.
PMC3103669,S160,,Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) have suggested possible endpoints for use in studies of gouty arthritis but these have yet to be validated.34
PMC3103669,S161,,The endpoints used in our study overlap with those suggested by OMERACT and use of patient self-reporting for flares is unlikely to have had an impact on the results.
PMC3103669,S162,,"Third, the study population is probably not representative of all patients who would benefit from canakinumab."
PMC3103669,S163,,This reflects the need to exclude patients with possible risks associated with either treatment and the use of the exclusion criteria generally used in clinical trials in patients with gouty arthritis.
PMC3103669,S164,,"Fourth, allopurinol treatment was initiated at 300 mg (or 100 mg or 200 mg if creatinine clearance was <90 ml/min) instead of slowly up-titrating from a dose of 50â€“100 mg, as suggested in treatment recommendations.12 33"
PMC3103669,S165,,This may have increased the risk of flares compared with a dose-titration strategy.
PMC3103669,S166,,"However, giving allopurinol at a fixed dose is a very common practice throughout Europe.12"
PMC3103669,S167,,"In conclusion, in this double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre study assessing prophylaxis against gouty arthritis flares during the initiation of ULT, a single canakinumab dose of 50â€“300 mg or 4-weekly dosing over 4 months provided effective prophylaxis against flares, was superior to the standard of care (colchicine) and was well tolerated."
PMC3103669,S168,,Further studies of canakinumab 150 mg are being conducted to determine the full potential of this new drug for the prevention of flares in patients with gouty arthritis.

PMC3109952,S7,,"Participants 240 patients aged 12 years and over, with a plantar wart that in the opinion of the healthcare professional was suitable for treatment with both cryotherapy and salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S8,,"Interventions Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen delivered by a healthcare professional, up to four treatments two to three weeks apart."
PMC3109952,S9,,Patient self treatment with 50% salicylic acid (Verrugon) daily up to a maximum of eight weeks.

PMC3109952,S18,,Introduction
PMC3109952,S19,,"Verrucae (or plantar warts) are extremely common, being experienced by most people at some time during their lives."
PMC3109952,S20,,"Studies that have examined the prevalence of warts or verrucae have produced a wide range of estimatesâ€”from 0.84% in the US,1 3.3% to 4.7% in the UK,2 3 and up to 24% in 16â€“18 year olds in Australia.4"
PMC3109952,S21,,"Although most plantar warts will spontaneously disappear without treatment,5 6 many patients seek treatment for a variety of reasons, including discomfort or because they are prevented from doing sports and other activities of daily living."
PMC3109952,S22,,"Almost two million people in England and Wales see their general practitioner for the treatment of cutaneous warts each year, at an annual cost of at least Â£40m.7"
PMC3109952,S23,,"There are many different treatments for cutaneous warts, including cryotherapy, topically applied treatments, surgical curettage, and complementary and alternative therapies."
PMC3109952,S24,,The most commonly prescribed treatments for plantar warts are cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and topical salicylic acid.8
PMC3109952,S25,,"A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effects of different local treatments of cutaneous, non-genital warts and highlighted considerable uncertainty around the optimal treatment.6"
PMC3109952,S26,,The best available evidence was for topical treatments containing salicylic acid (of various strengths).
PMC3109952,S27,,These preparations were significantly better than placebo.
PMC3109952,S28,,Data pooled from five placebo controlled trials showed a cure rate of 117/160 (73%) compared with 78/162 (48%) in controls.
PMC3109952,S29,,"Evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy was limited: the review found two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid, and one comparing it with duct tape."
PMC3109952,S30,,These trials showed no significant difference in efficacy for the compared treatments.
PMC3109952,S31,,"More recently, a head to head trial compared salicylic acid and cryotherapy in a primary care setting in the Netherlands."
PMC3109952,S32,,"This trial found that cryotherapy was significantly better than salicylic acid for the treatment of hand warts, but that there was no significant difference between treatments for plantar warts.9"
PMC3109952,S33,,The Cochrane systematic review further highlighted the lack of good quality evidence on which to inform clinical decision making.
PMC3109952,S34,,"Of the 60 trials identified in the review, 46 (77%) were classified as low quality, heterogeneity between the trials was high, and analyses were often inappropriate or misleading."
PMC3109952,S35,,A major conclusion from the review was that a trial comparing topical salicylic acid with cryotherapy was urgently needed.
PMC3109952,S36,,We therefore conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of 50% salicylic acid and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen.

PMC3109952,S116,,"In total, 229 participants had a response for whether there was complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after randomisation, with 206 (90%) having a blinded outcome assessment: 159 (69%) had a blinded outcome assessment from a digital photograph (cryotherapy=80, salicylic acid=79), 47 (21%) had a blinded outcome assessment from a healthcare professional (cryotherapy=22, salicylic acid=25), four (2%) had an unblinded outcome assessment from a healthcare professional (cryotherapy=1, salicylic acid=3), and 19 (8%) had patient self assessment (cryotherapy=7, salicylic acid=12)."
PMC3109952,S117,,"Overall, 32 of the 229 (14%) had complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks, corresponding to 17/119 (14%) patients in the salicylic acid group and 15/110 (14%) patients in the cryotherapy group, with no significant difference between the two groups (difference 0.65% (95% confidence interval â€“8.33 to 9.63), P=0.89)."
PMC3109952,S118,,"Cohenâ€™s Îº measure, used to assess the agreement between the two assessors of the photographs, was estimated to be 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.55), which indicates a moderate level of agreement."
PMC3109952,S119,,"The assessors disagreed in 51 cases: in three cases the disagreement was between whether the plantar wart was â€œclearedâ€ù or â€œnot cleared,â€ù in five cases it was between â€œclearedâ€ù and â€œunable to assess,â€ù and in the remaining 43 cases it was between â€œnot clearedâ€ù and â€œunable to assess.â€ù"
PMC3109952,S120,,"This might lead to an underestimation of the clearance rate, but as the assessment was blind to treatment allocation it is unlikely to lead to a difference between the two treatments groups."
PMC3109952,S121,,Secondary outcome
PMC3109952,S122,,"The primary analysis was repeated after controlling for age, whether the plantar warts had been previously treated (yes or no), and the type of plantar wart (mosaic or non-mosaic, where a mosaic was defined as a group of numerous, closely aggregated plantar warts on the sole of the foot)."
PMC3109952,S123,,"Logistic regression analysis showed no evidence of a difference between the salicylic acid and cryotherapy groups (odds ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.11), P=0.92 which favours the salicylic group)."
PMC3109952,S124,,We received patient self reported data on presence or absence of plantar warts at six months from 193 participants.
PMC3109952,S125,,"Overall, 62 (32%) of the patients had complete clearance of all plantar warts at six monthsâ€”29/95 (31%) of patients in the salicylic acid group and 33/98 (34%) in the cryotherapy group, with no significant difference between the groups (difference â€“3.15% (â€“16.31 to 10.02), P=0.64)."
PMC3109952,S126,,"The findings from the adjusted analysis were similar to those of the unadjusted analysis (odds ratio 1.17 (0.62 to 2.21), P=0.62)."
PMC3109952,S127,,"The median number of plantar warts at 12 weeks in the salicylic acid group was two (range 0â€“20) and in the cryotherapy group was one (0â€“40), and no significant difference between the two groups (incident rate ratio 1.08 (0.81 to 1.43), P=0.62)."
PMC3109952,S128,,The number of plantar warts at the start of the study was not found to be an important predictor of outcome (odds ratio 0.81 (0.65 to 1.01)).
PMC3109952,S129,,"We compared the time to clearance of the plantar warts between the two groups adjusting for the same covariates as above (age, previous treatment, and type of wart)."
PMC3109952,S130,,"There was no evidence of a difference in the time to clearance between cryotherapy and salicylic acid in the Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio 0.80 (0.51 to 1.25), P=0.33)."
PMC3109952,S131,,"The proportional hazard assumption was tested and not violated, either separately for each covariate (cryotherapy v salicylic acid (P=0.3107), age (P=0.9508), type of plantar wart (P=0.7024), previous treatment (P=0.4456)) or globally (P=0.8208)."
PMC3109952,S132,,Hence all hazard ratios were assumed constant during the follow-up period.
PMC3109952,S133,,Satisfaction with treatment
PMC3109952,S134,,"Patients were asked to rate their satisfaction with their treatment on a five point scale from â€œvery happyâ€ù to â€œvery unhappyâ€ù on a postal or web based questionnaire at one, three, and 12 weeks (see table 5)."
PMC3109952,S135,,"There was a significant association between patient satisfaction with treatment and randomised treatment at each of the three time points (Fisherâ€™s exact test P=0.0336 for week 1, P=0.0020 for week 3, P=0.0065 for week 12)."
PMC3109952,S136,,"At week 1, more patients were happy with salicylic acid than cryotherapy but also more patients were very happy with cryotherapy than salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S137,,"At week 3, more patients were unhappy with salicylic acid than with cryotherapy (none), and more patients were very happy with cryotherapy than salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S138,,"At week 12, more patients were unhappy with salicylic acid than with cryotherapy, and more were very happy with cryotherapy than with salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S139,,This is not expected if satisfaction with treatment was independent of treatment randomised.

PMC3109952,S141,,(Values are numbers (percentages) of patients)
PMC3109952,S142,,Adverse events
PMC3109952,S143,,"Data on adverse events were collected by the treating healthcare professional, by review of patientsâ€™ medical notes by the trial coordinator at site monitoring visits, or by review of participant follow-up questionnaires."
PMC3109952,S144,,A total of 28 adverse events were reported in 19 participants.
PMC3109952,S145,,"Of these, one event (a ruptured Achilles tendon requiring hospitalisation) was classed as serious and unrelated to the trial treatment (salicylic acid)."
PMC3109952,S146,,"The remaining 27 were assessed as non-serious, 13 of which were in the salicylic acid group and 14 in the cryotherapy group."
PMC3109952,S147,,"Of the 13 non-serious adverse events in the salicylic acid group, nine were unrelated to the trial treatment and four were unlikely to be related to the treatment."
PMC3109952,S148,,"In the cryotherapy group, there were two treatment related, non-serious adverse events in two participants."
PMC3109952,S149,,Both participants developed a blister that was larger than expected in routine practice.
PMC3109952,S150,,The remaining 12 adverse events in the cryotherapy group were either unrelated to the trial treatment (7) or unlikely to be related (5).
PMC3109952,S151,,Discussion
PMC3109952,S152,,Key findings
PMC3109952,S153,,We compared the clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and 50% salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts and found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness.
PMC3109952,S154,,"However, cryotherapy was associated with higher costs per cured patient, which leads to salicylic acid being a more attractive treatment."
PMC3109952,S155,,Comparison with other studies
PMC3109952,S156,,Our results confirm the findings of the two published studies comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid10 11 and the results from a more recent Dutch primary care study9 which compared cryotherapy with salicylic acid or a combination of salicylic and lactic acid for the treatment of plantar and hand warts.
PMC3109952,S157,,These studies also showed no evidence that cryotherapy was more effective than salicylic acid (alone or in combination with lactic acid).
PMC3109952,S158,,"Our trial, however, does differ from the previous studies in respect to the cure rate."
PMC3109952,S159,,"Our overall cure rate was 14% (32/229), whereas cure rates in the earlier studies ranged from about 30%9 to 68%,11 at least twice the rate we observed."
PMC3109952,S160,,This difference in cure rate could be attributed to different populations recruited to the study.
PMC3109952,S161,,"For example, Bunney et al included only patients with hand warts,10 while Steele and Irwin excluded mosaic warts,11 which are generally regarded as more resistant to treatment."
PMC3109952,S162,,"They also excluded patients with five or more lesions, lesions outside an average diameter of 3â€“9 mm, and patients who had self treated within the previous month."
PMC3109952,S163,,"In our study 22% of participants had a mosaic wart, 17% had more than five verrucae, and most had already tried other treatments."
PMC3109952,S164,,There was also a difference in the age of the populations.
PMC3109952,S165,,"Patients were younger in the studies by Bruggink et al9 and Steele and Irwin,11 with 59% of participants under the age of 16 in the latter study compared with 17% in our study."
PMC3109952,S166,,The median age of patients in Bruggink et alâ€™s study was 15 years (interquartile range 7â€“39) for cryotherapy patients and 13 (7â€“31) years for salicylic acid patients compared with median ages of 24 and 23 respectively in our study.
PMC3109952,S167,,Strengths and limitations of the study
PMC3109952,S168,,"The strengths of this study include adequate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, and intention to treat analysis, all of which minimises the risk of bias."
PMC3109952,S169,,"A further strength is that this was a large pragmatic study that recruited patients from 14 centres across England, Scotland, and Ireland from podiatry clinics, general practices, and from the community."
PMC3109952,S170,,"The participants had longstanding plantar warts, most of which had been self treated."
PMC3109952,S171,,"This is typical of the characteristics of patients presenting to healthcare professionals for treatment, so we can be confident that these results are broadly generalisable and that the study has external validity across the UK and Ireland."
PMC3109952,S172,,Our study has several potential limitations.
PMC3109952,S173,,"Firstly, our sample size was powered to show a 15% difference in effectiveness, with cure rates of 70% for the salicylic acid treatment and 85% for the cryotherapy."
PMC3109952,S174,,"However, the overall cure rate achieved in this trial was much lower at 14% with a 0.65% difference in cure rates."
PMC3109952,S175,,"Secondly, it has been suggested that a six month follow-up is a more realistic time point at which to assess the success of treatments of cutaneous warts than shorter time frames.6"
PMC3109952,S176,,Assessment at six months not only allows for the fact that the human papilloma virus may remain dormant within epithelial cells without visible disease but would also allow time for any response mediated by the immune system to be observed.
PMC3109952,S177,,"However, we chose to assess the primary outcome in our study at 12 weeks because we know many plantar warts spontaneously resolve, so the important clinical question is whether treating plantar warts makes them go sooner."
PMC3109952,S178,,We considered that 12 weeks is a reasonable time frame in which to expect a treatment for plantar warts to be effective.
PMC3109952,S179,,"In this study neither treatment was very effective with only 17/119 (14%) in the salicylic acid group and 15/110 (14%) in the cryotherapy group having complete clearance of plantar warts at 12 weeks, but the lack of a no treatment arm in this study means we cannot compare these cure rates with the natural resolution rate."
PMC3109952,S180,,"Finally, participants allocated to the salicylic acid group were advised to self treat for a maximum of eight weeks, but we collected patient self reported data on adherence to treatment only at one and three weeks after randomisation."
PMC3109952,S181,,"Self reported adherence at these times was reasonably high, with participants applying salicylic acid on a mean of 6.3 days and 5.4 days out of seven respectively."
PMC3109952,S182,,"However, data collected by the healthcare professionals about the total amount of acid applied during the course of the trial (mean amount applied 2.8 g) could suggest a lower adherence for the treatment period overall."
PMC3109952,S183,,"For some deep seated plantar warts, this might not have been sufficient to clear the wart."
PMC3109952,S184,,Conclusion and implications of results
PMC3109952,S185,,Here we report the results of a high quality trial evaluating two common treatments for plantar warts.
PMC3109952,S186,,We found no evidence that cryotherapy is more effective than patient self treatment with 50% salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts.
PMC3109952,S187,,"If we add our trial data into a meta-analysis, we find the odds ratio for cure is 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.79), indicating that the odds of clearance of plantar warts is similar with either treatment."
PMC3109952,S188,,"However, the only salicylic acid preparation we evaluated was at a 50% concentration, which is not the most commonly used."
PMC3109952,S189,,This concentration of salicylic acid is similar to that often used by podiatrists to treat plantar warts and is often viewed as a second line treatment.
PMC3109952,S190,,"Typically, first line treatments in the UK are weaker preparations of 15%â€“26% salicylic acid."
PMC3109952,S191,,The Cochrane systematic review identified only one trial that compared two different concentrations of salicylic acid.6
PMC3109952,S192,,"This trial found no evidence of a difference in the cure rates between the two treatments, but, as this trial was assessed as being of low quality, we cannot rule out the possibility that different cure rates might be achieved with different strengths of acid."
PMC3109952,S193,,It is therefore possible that cryotherapy is a superior treatment against lower concentrations of salicylic acid.
PMC3109952,S194,,Nor did we evaluate the effectiveness of salicylic acid treatment if delivered by a healthcare professional.
PMC3109952,S195,,"There are other treatments available for cutaneous warts, but little good quality evidence assessing their effectiveness."
PMC3109952,S196,,Further research assessing the effectiveness of these treatments is required in order to inform future practice.
PMC3109952,S197,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3109952,S198,,"Most plantar warts spontaneously disappear without treatment, but patients may seek treatment if the warts are painful or because they are being prevented from doing sports and other activities of daily living"
PMC3109952,S199,,"There are many different ways to treat plantar warts, but the evidence base to inform clinical decision making is poor"
PMC3109952,S200,,What this study adds
PMC3109952,S201,,There is no evidence to suggest that cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen was more clinically effective than patient self treatment with 50% salicylic acid in clearing plantar warts
PMC3109952,S202,,"Since cryotherapy is substantially more expensive than treatment with salicylic acid, this makes salicylic acid the more cost effective treatment"

PMC3128457,S4,,Objective To assess the effect of tranexamic acid (which reduces bleeding in surgical patients and reduces mortality due to bleeding in trauma patients) on intracranial haemorrhage in patients with traumatic brain injury.
PMC3128457,S5,,"Methods A nested, randomised, placebo controlled trial."
PMC3128457,S6,,All investigators were masked to treatment allocation.
PMC3128457,S7,,All analyses were by intention to treat.
PMC3128457,S8,,"Patients 270 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant extracranial bleeding within 8 hours of injury, who also had traumatic brain injury."
PMC3128457,S9,,"Interventions Patients randomly allocated to tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes, then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo."
PMC3128457,S10,,"Main outcome measures Intracranial haemorrhage growth (measured by computed tomography) between hospital admission and then 24â€“48 hours later, with adjustment for Glasgow coma score, age, time from injury to the scans, and initial haemorrhage volume."
PMC3128457,S11,,"Results Of the 133 patients allocated to tranexamic acid and 137 allocated to placebo, 123 (92%) and 126 (92%) respectively provided information on the primary outcome."
PMC3128457,S12,,All patients provided information on clinical outcomes.
PMC3128457,S13,,The mean total haemorrhage growth was 5.9 ml (SD 26.8) and 8.1 mL (SD 29.2) in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups respectively (adjusted difference â€“3.8 mL (95% confidence interval âˆ’11.5 to 3.9)).
PMC3128457,S14,,New focal cerebral ischaemic lesions occurred in 6 (5%) patients in the tranexamic acid group versus 12 (9%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.44)).
PMC3128457,S15,,There were 14 (11%) deaths in the tranexamic acid group and 24 (18%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0.47 (0.21 to 1.04)).
PMC3128457,S16,,Conclusions This trial shows that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury can be excluded.

PMC3128457,S18,,Trial registration ISRCTN86750102.
PMC3128457,S19,,Introduction
PMC3128457,S20,,"The antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce blood loss in surgical patients and the risk of death in patients with traumatic bleeding, with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive events.1 2"
PMC3128457,S21,,These findings raise the possibility that it might be effective in other situations in which bleeding can be life threatening or disabling.
PMC3128457,S22,,Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
PMC3128457,S23,,Each year more than 1.5 million people die and about 10 million people are hospitalised after traumatic brain injury.3
PMC3128457,S24,,A complication of such injury is intracranial haemorrhage.
PMC3128457,S25,,Its frequency varies according to the injury severity.
PMC3128457,S26,,"In the MRC CRASH Trial, which included patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injury, three quarters of patients had intracranial haemorrhage.4"
PMC3128457,S27,,In about half of patients with intracranial haemorrhage the lesion enlarges after hospital admission.5 6
PMC3128457,S28,,Patients with large haemorrhages are at substantially greater risk of death than those with small haemorrhages.7
PMC3128457,S29,,About a third of patients with traumatic brain injury have coagulopathy.
PMC3128457,S30,,Those with coagulopathy have an increased risk of haemorrhage growth and higher mortality.8
PMC3128457,S31,,"Increased fibrinolysis, as indicated by high levels of fibrinogen degradation products, is a common feature of the coagulopathy in traumatic brain injury, raising the possibility that tranexamic acid might reduce traumatic intracranial haemorrhage.9"
PMC3128457,S32,,"To date, there have been no randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury.10"
PMC3128457,S33,,"The CRASH-2 trial recruited 20Â 211 trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant (extracranial) haemorrhage."
PMC3128457,S34,,"Although traumatic brain injury was not an inclusion criterion, it is likely that a substantial proportion of included patients would also have had traumatic brain injury."
PMC3128457,S35,,"However, to keep data collection to a minimum, and ensure recruitment to detect the main outcome (overall mortality), computed tomography data were not routinely collected."
PMC3128457,S36,,"Nevertheless, the CRASH-2 trial represented a unique opportunity to nest an exploratory study collecting computed tomography data to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid on outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury."
PMC3128457,S37,,The CRASH-2 Intracranial Bleeding Study was a prospective randomised controlled trial nested within the CRASH-2 trial to quantify the effect of an early short course of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage in patients with traumatic brain injury.

PMC3128457,S128,,We recruited 270 patients (133 allocated to tranexamic acid and 137 allocated to placebo) between August 2008 and January 2010 (figure).This nested study was stopped when the main CRASH-2 trialâ€™s pre-specified sample size of 20Â 000 was achieved.
PMC3128457,S129,,"All patients received the loading and maintenance doses, except one patient allocated placebo who did not receive the maintenance dose."
PMC3128457,S130,,All patients were followed up for clinical outcomes.
PMC3128457,S131,,A total of 256 patients (95%) had the first computed tomography scan.
PMC3128457,S132,,"In 14 patients (six allocated to tranexamic acid, eight controls allocated to placebo), the first scan was unavailable for reading for technical reasons."

PMC3128457,S164,,"No emergency unblinding was needed, and there were no adverse events regarded as serious, unexpected, or suspected to be related to the study treatment."
PMC3128457,S165,,We also found that an increase in haemorrhage growth of 10 mL was strongly associated with dependency at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio 1.32 (1.08 to 1.62)).
PMC3128457,S166,,Discussion
PMC3128457,S167,,"This is the first randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury, and we found that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects can be excluded."
PMC3128457,S168,,"However, despite the relatively wide confidence intervals, our analyses suggest that tranexamic acid administration might improve outcome after traumatic brain injury and provide grounds for evaluating this hypothesis in future research."
PMC3128457,S169,,"The Intracranial Bleeding Study was conducted among patients with traumatic brain injury who also had significant extracranial haemorrhage, and the effect of tranexamic acid might be different in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury."
PMC3128457,S170,,"It has been suggested that, among patients with traumatic brain injury, only those with hypotension activate the fibrinolytic response.18"
PMC3128457,S171,,"It is possible that in our study population tranexamic acid reduced extracranial bleeding, and therefore patients in the tranexamic acid group were less hypotensive, and less coagulopathic, and through this mechanism tranexamic acid reduced the expansion of intracranial bleeding."
PMC3128457,S172,,"However, only 7% of the included patients had a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg."
PMC3128457,S173,,"Furthermore, we did not find evidence of treatment interaction according to systolic blood pressure at admission (P value for interaction for haemorrhage growth 0.38)."
PMC3128457,S174,,"Additionally, a recent paper has challenged this basic hypothesis by reporting that coagulopathy is also found in traumatic brain injury patients without hypotension.19"
PMC3128457,S175,,"The larger effect on haematoma growth observed in surgical patients is consistent with the evidence of effectiveness of antifibrinolytic agents in elective surgery, for which antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to reduce blood loss.1"
PMC3128457,S176,,We found a reduction in new focal cerebral ischaemic lesions in the patients allocated tranexamic acid.
PMC3128457,S177,,"However, the overall incidence of these lesions was low, and it is possible that the observed difference between the groups may have arisen by chance alone."
PMC3128457,S178,,"Nevertheless, it is plausible that if tranexamic acid reduces haemorrhage growth then this could reduce the local pressure on arteries."
PMC3128457,S179,,Any reduction in intracranial pressure might also reduce the risk of ischaemia.
PMC3128457,S180,,"Given that tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality from bleeding, it is also possible that patients allocated to tranexamic acid may have had a more stable circulation and that this may have accounted for the observed reduction in ischaemic lesions."
PMC3128457,S181,,"Our findings differ from those reported in a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which found that tranexamic acid reduced the rate of re-bleeding but increased cerebral ischaemia.20"
PMC3128457,S182,,"However, the doses of tranexamic acid used in these trials were larger and more prolonged than in our study."
PMC3128457,S183,,"Furthermore, the risk and mechanism of cerebral ischaemia is different in the two conditions."
PMC3128457,S184,,"Regarding the clinical outcomes, although the results were not statistically significant, we found a trend towards a reduction in mortality, without any evidence of increase in dependency among survivors."
PMC3128457,S185,,When we assessed the effect of tranexamic acid on a composite outcome that considered poor computed tomography and clinical outcomes we found a statistically significant reduction.
PMC3128457,S186,,"Importantly, this composite outcome was pre-specified, and the effect on all the outcomes included in the composite outcome showed the same direction towards benefit.21"
PMC3128457,S187,,Strengths and limitations of study
PMC3128457,S188,,Our study has several strengths.
PMC3128457,S189,,"It was a prospective study which collected detailed computed tomographic data, with clear inclusion criteria, pre-specified outcomes, and statistical analysis plan."
PMC3128457,S190,,"The randomisation methods ensured that participating clinicians did not have foreknowledge of treatment allocation, baseline clinical factors were well balanced, there was high follow-up, and all analyses were performed on an intention to treat basis."
PMC3128457,S191,,"Although there were baseline differences between patients allocated tranexamic acid and those allocated placebo in some scan findings, the adjusted analyses should have accounted for any imbalance."
PMC3128457,S192,,"We attempted to minimise measurement error through the use of central computed tomogram reading by an experienced neuroradiologist, following a pre-specified validated protocol of qualitative and quantitative methods to assess brain damage."
PMC3128457,S193,,"The protocol used previously validated methods, and those that had not been previously validated were further tested in the present study."
PMC3128457,S194,,We found that intra-rater reliability was high for most imaging measurements.
PMC3128457,S195,,"Among the limitations, our study included only a relatively small sample of the CRASH-2 participants with traumatic brain injury, and a larger sample size could have provided more precise results."
PMC3128457,S196,,The nature of a large pragmatic trial such as the CRASH-2 trial constrained our ability to collect computed tomograms for all the patients with traumatic brain injury included in the CRASH-2 trial.
PMC3128457,S197,,"Nevertheless, the relatively small sample size does not affect the internal validity of this study, and, although imprecise, the results should be unbiased."
PMC3128457,S198,,Implications of results
PMC3128457,S199,,"The CRASH-2 trial has shown reliably that early administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding reduces the risk of all cause mortality."
PMC3128457,S200,,"As a consequence of this trial, tranexamic acid has been incorporated into trauma treatment protocols worldwide."
PMC3128457,S201,,"Many patients with traumatic haemorrhage also have traumatic brain injury, and concerns about the risk of cerebral ischaemia may affect decisions whether to give tranexamic acid to these patients.22"
PMC3128457,S202,,"The results presented here are the only available evidence to inform doctors about the effect of tranexamic acid on brain ischaemic lesions in patients with traumatic haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, and, although imprecise, the results should give some reassurance about the safety of tranexamic acid in such patients."
PMC3128457,S203,,Our results also have important research implications.
PMC3128457,S204,,"In theory, if tranexamic acid reduces intracranial haemorrhage after traumatic brain injury without increasing the risk of ischaemic lesions, it could substantially improve patient outcomes."
PMC3128457,S205,,"Until now, however, no trial has evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury."
PMC3128457,S206,,"Our results suggest it is probable that, in such patients, the benefits of tranexamic acid administration would outweigh the risks."
PMC3128457,S207,,If such an inexpensive and widely practicable treatment were found to improve patient outcomes after traumatic intracranial haemorrhage this would have major implications for clinical care.
PMC3128457,S208,,The CRASH-3 trial (http://crash3.lshtm.ac.uk/) will determine reliably the effectiveness of the early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury.
PMC3128457,S209,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3128457,S210,,"Intracranial bleeding is a common complication in patients with traumatic brain injury, and about a third of patients with traumatic brain injury have coagulopathy at hospital admission"
PMC3128457,S211,,"The antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid reduces mortality in trauma patients with significant extracranial bleeding, but no randomised study has evaluated its effects in patients with traumatic brain injury"
PMC3128457,S212,,What this study adds
PMC3128457,S213,,"In this randomised, placebo controlled trial neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury could be excluded"
PMC3128457,S214,,"However, the non-significant trends to beneficial effects justify a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the early administration of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury"
PMC3128457,S215,,"An early short course of tranexamic acid seems to be safe (in relation to new ischaemic brain lesions) in patients with trauma, extracranial significant bleeding, and concomitant traumatic brain injury"

PMC3242163,S2,,Effects on 11-year mortality and morbidity of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin for about 5 years in 20â€ˆ536 high-risk individuals: a randomised controlled trial
PMC3242163,S3,,Summary
PMC3242163,S4,,Background
PMC3242163,S5,,"Findings of large randomised trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol with statins reduces vascular morbidity and mortality rapidly, but limited evidence exists about the long-term efficacy and safety of statin treatment."
PMC3242163,S6,,"The aim of the extended follow-up of the Heart Protection Study (HPS) is to assess long-term efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol with statins, and here we report cause-specific mortality and major morbidity in the in-trial and post-trial periods."
PMC3242163,S7,,Methods
PMC3242163,S8,,"20â€ˆ536 patients at high risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes were allocated either 40 mg simvastatin daily or placebo, using minimised randomisation."
PMC3242163,S9,,"Mean in-trial follow-up was 5Â·3 years (SD 1Â·2), and post-trial follow-up of surviving patients yielded a mean total duration of 11Â·0 years (SD 0Â·6)."
PMC3242163,S10,,"The primary outcome of the long-term follow-up of HPS was first post-randomisation major vascular event, and analysis was by intention to treat."
PMC3242163,S11,,"This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 48489393."
PMC3242163,S12,,Findings
PMC3242163,S13,,"During the in-trial period, allocation to simvastatin yielded an average reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1Â·0 mmol/L and a proportional decrease in major vascular events of 23% (95% CI 19â€“28; p<0Â·0001), with significant divergence each year after the first."
PMC3242163,S14,,"During the post-trial period (when statin use and lipid concentrations were similar in both groups), no further significant reductions were noted in either major vascular events (risk ratio [RR] 0Â·95 [0Â·89â€“1Â·02]) or vascular mortality (0Â·98 [0Â·90â€“1Â·07])."
PMC3242163,S15,,"During the combined in-trial and post-trial periods, no significant differences were recorded in cancer incidence at all sites (0Â·98 [0Â·92â€“1Â·05]) or any particular site, or in mortality attributed to cancer (1Â·01 [0Â·92â€“1Â·11]) or to non-vascular causes (0Â·96 [0Â·89â€“1Â·03])."
PMC3242163,S16,,Interpretation
PMC3242163,S17,,More prolonged LDL-lowering statin treatment produces larger absolute reductions in vascular events.
PMC3242163,S18,,"Moreover, even after study treatment stopped in HPS, benefits persisted for at least 5 years without any evidence of emerging hazards."
PMC3242163,S19,,These findings provide further support for the prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin treatment.

PMC3242163,S22,,Introduction
PMC3242163,S23,,"The Medical Research Council and British Heart Foundation (MRC/BHF) Heart Protection Study (HPS), among 20â€ˆ000 patients at high risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes, was established to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol concentrations substantially with statin treatment.1"
PMC3242163,S24,,"Collectively, findings of HPS and other major trials of statins provide compelling evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol by about 1 mmol/L reduces vascular mortality and morbidity by about a quarter in a wide range of patients (including elderly people and those with low cholesterol concentrations), without increasing the risk of non-vascular mortality or morbidity (apart from a small myopathy excess) during about 5 years of treatment.2â€“4"
PMC3242163,S25,,"As a result, many people are now prescribed long-term statin treatment to reduce their vascular risk."
PMC3242163,S26,,"During prolonged follow-up in observational epidemiological studies, lower blood cholesterol concentrations have been associated with higher rates of particular types of cancer, and with other non-vascular morbidity and mortality.5,6"
PMC3242163,S27,,"It has been suggested, therefore, that lowering LDL cholesterol (particularly to low levels) might produce increases in the rates of cancers and other types of adverse events that take longer than 5 years to emerge.7â€“9"
PMC3242163,S28,,Only limited evidence about long-term safety has been reported from statin trials.10â€“14
PMC3242163,S29,,"We aimed to assess the effects of lowering LDL cholesterol on cause-specific mortality and major morbidity, not only during the study treatment period in HPS but also in the longer term, post-trial."

PMC3242163,S64,,"Of 20â€ˆ536 participants, 17â€ˆ519 were still alive at the start of the post-trial follow-up period: 8863 allocated simvastatin versus 8656 placebo (ratio 1Â·02; because simvastatin reduced mortality).2"

PMC3242163,S66,,Response rates to mailed questionnaires and from family doctors during the post-trial period were high and did not differ by previous statin allocation (table 1).

PMC3242163,S71,,"During the post-trial period, self-reported statin use was similar in both groups, rising from about 59% at the end of the first year to 84% by the end of the fifth year (table 2)."
PMC3242163,S72,,This similarity in statin use between groups was supported by similar LDL cholesterol concentrations (2Â·6 [SE 0Â·03] vs 2Â·6 [0Â·03] mmol/L; p=0Â·7: table 3) after 3Â·2 years of post-trial follow-up.

PMC3242163,S122,,Panel
PMC3242163,S123,,Research in context
PMC3242163,S124,,Systematic review
PMC3242163,S125,,"Electronic searches of Medline, PubMed, and Scopus, supplemented by hand searches of reference lists of meta-analyses and other review articles, identified reports from five large randomised trials of statin therapy with post-trial follow-up of clinical outcomes."
PMC3242163,S126,,"These previous reports included limited numbers of major vascular events, incident cancers, and non-vascular deaths during prolonged post-trial follow-up, making reliable assessment of persistence of benefit or emergence of any hazard difficult."
PMC3242163,S127,,Interpretation
PMC3242163,S128,,"Prolonged follow-up in the Heart Protection Study now shows that reduction of about a quarter in vascular mortality and morbidityâ€”produced by an average 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol with 5 years of statin therapyâ€”persisted largely unchanged during the subsequent 6 years, despite similar LDL cholesterol concentrations and statin use in both treatment groups."
PMC3242163,S129,,"Reassuringly, no adverse effects on particular causes of non-vascular mortality or major morbidity (including site-specific cancers) were seen to emerge during prolonged follow-up."
PMC3242163,S130,,These findings support prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin treatment in people at increased risk of vascular events.
PMC3242163,S131,,Prolonged post-trial follow-up of participants in HPS shows that the substantial reduction in vascular mortality and morbidity produced during an average 5-year reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1 mmol/L with simvastatin persisted largely unchanged during the subsequent 6 years.
PMC3242163,S132,,"Reassuringly, there was no evidence that any adverse effect on particular causes of non-vascular mortality or major morbidity (including site-specific cancers) was emerging during this prolonged follow-up period (panel)."
PMC3242163,S133,,"Study treatment was not routinely unblinded at the end of the in-trial period of HPS, and no differences between treatment groups were recorded in statin use or LDL cholesterol concentrations during post-trial follow-up."
PMC3242163,S134,,"In each year of post-trial follow-up, about a fifth of the surviving participants did not return their postal questionnaire, but information about non-fatal clinical events was obtained from family doctors for about half of these non-responders, and the completeness of follow-up was similar in the two treatment groups."
PMC3242163,S135,,"Furthermore, information on site-specific cancers and cause-specific mortality was obtained from national registries for almost all randomised patients throughout both the in-trial and the post-trial periods."
PMC3242163,S136,,"As a result, although the power to detect any effects might have been reduced slightly by some events having been missed, this occurrence should not have introduced any bias."
PMC3242163,S137,,"Hence, the large numbers of major vascular events that were recorded during the post-trial period of follow-up in HPS provide robust evidence about the persistence of the cardiovascular benefits produced by previous statin treatment."
PMC3242163,S138,,"Similarly, the large numbers of other types of outcome recorded during prolonged follow-up provide compelling evidence that 5 years of statin therapy is not associated with excesses of any particular type of non-vascular death, site-specific cancer, or other major non-vascular morbidity."
PMC3242163,S139,,"Moreover, although 11 years might still not be long enough for deleterious effects on cancer to emerge fully, no adverse trend was noted, even during the later years of post-trial follow-up."
PMC3242163,S140,,The findings of HPS for persistence of vascular benefits are generally consistent with the results for follow-up beyond the scheduled treatment period from four other large (>1000 participants) randomised trials of statin treatment (webappendix p 1; one other such trial has only reported the results for the in-trial and post-trial period combined).14
PMC3242163,S141,,"In 4S,10 in which over 4000 people with coronary disease were studied, vascular mortality during 5 years of post-trial follow-up was non-significantly higher among those originally allocated simvastatin, but non-fatal vascular events were not reported."
PMC3242163,S142,,"Perhaps due to routine unblinding at the end of the in-trial period, use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (usually simvastatin) after 3 years of post-trial follow-up was slightly higher among participants originally allocated simvastatin (86% vs 82%)."
PMC3242163,S143,,"In LIPID,11 in which over 9000 people with coronary disease were included, vascular mortality during 2 years of post-trial follow-up was significantly (p=0Â·02) lower among those originally allocated pravastatin."
PMC3242163,S144,,"After routine unblinding at the end of the in-trial period, both groups were encouraged to take pravastatin 40 mg daily and similar proportions commenced it (88% vs 86%), and blood lipid levels were similar during each of the post-trial years."
PMC3242163,S145,,"In WOSCOPS,12 in which over 6000 men without known coronary disease were enrolled, significantly fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions or coronary deaths (p=0Â·02) and non-significantly fewer strokes (p=0Â·22) were seen during 10 years of post-trial follow-up."
PMC3242163,S146,,"Again, perhaps due to routine unblinding, a slightly higher proportion of those originally allocated pravastatin were taking statins during the first 5 years of post-trial follow-up (29% vs 24% at 1 year and 39% vs 35% at 5 years)."
PMC3242163,S147,,"In ASCOT-LLA,13 which involved 10â€ˆ000 people with hypertension, the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death during 2 years of post-trial follow-up was significantly (p=0Â·005) lower among those originally allocated atorvastatin."
PMC3242163,S148,,"At the end of the lipid-lowering treatment period, atorvastatin was offered to all participants (who were not routinely unblinded) and a slightly higher proportion of those originally allocated atorvastatin were taking statin treatment at the end of the post-trial period (67% vs 63%), although lipid profiles were broadly similar."
PMC3242163,S149,,"Concerns have been raised that lower blood cholesterol concentrations could be associated with an increased incidence of cancer or some other non-vascular outcomes.5,6,9,16"
PMC3242163,S150,,"The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis of about 130â€ˆ000 patients in 21 trials of statin versus control (including HPS), which included about 7000 incident cancers and 3000 non-vascular deaths during an average 5-year LDL cholesterol reduction of 1 mmol/L, did not find any excess of particular types of cancer or non-vascular death.4"
PMC3242163,S151,,"But, if adverse effects were caused by lowering cholesterol then they might only emerge after longer term follow-up."
PMC3242163,S152,,"Previously, the numbers and types of non-vascular outcomes reported from prolonged post-trial follow-up in statin trials have been limited (webappendix p 2)."
PMC3242163,S153,,"In ASCOT-LLA,13 only mortality during 2 years of post-trial follow-up was reported, with previous allocation to atorvastatin not associated with an excess in non-vascular mortality."
PMC3242163,S154,,"Furthermore, the LIPID study group has only reported 2 years of post-trial follow-up,11 with no significant differences in deaths from all types of non-vascular cause combined or in incidence of cancers at all sites combined."
PMC3242163,S155,,"4S has reported 5 years of post-trial follow-up,10 with no apparent differences in all types of non-vascular mortality or cancer incidence at all sites."
PMC3242163,S156,,"10 years of post-trial follow-up has been reported in WOSCOPS,12 with no apparent differences in total non-vascular mortality or cancer incidence."
PMC3242163,S157,,"In WOSCOPS, more of the men originally allocated pravastatin did have prostate cancer diagnosed during the combined follow-up period (89 [2Â·7%] vs 59 [1Â·8%]), but there were few such cancers and the difference was not statistically convincing (p=0Â·03)."
PMC3242163,S158,,The much larger numbers of men in HPS who were found to have developed prostate cancer (367 [4Â·7%] simvastatin vs 348 [4Â·5%] placebo) during 11 years of follow-up show that substantial reductions in cholesterol with statin treatment do not materially increase its incidence (1Â·03 [0Â·89â€“1Â·20]; p=0Â·67).
PMC3242163,S159,,"In HPS, among participants allocated simvastatin, fewer major vascular events were noted in the first year after randomisation and significant reductions of about a quarter were seen in each separate year of the in-trial period."
PMC3242163,S160,,These findings suggest that the absolute benefits of prolonged statin treatment are likely to be much greater than is indicated by analyses restricted merely to in-trial periods of statin trials.
PMC3242163,S161,,"Moreover, even after in-study statin treatment stopped in HPS, the benefits persisted for several years."
PMC3242163,S162,,"As well as providing reliable evidence about the long-term benefits of statin therapy, the large numbers of other major health outcomes recorded during prolonged follow-up in HPS provide considerable reassuranceâ€”both to prescribers and to patientsâ€”about the long-term safety of lowering LDL cholesterol substantially for about 5 years."
PMC3242163,S163,,These findings provide further support for the prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin treatment in people at increased risk of vascular events.

PMC3266479,S4,,Background
PMC3266479,S5,,"In a previous randomised controlled phase 2 trial, intravenous infusion of salbutamol for up to 7 days in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reduced extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure."

PMC3266479,S7,,Methods
PMC3266479,S8,,"We did a multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised trial at 46 UK intensive-care units between December, 2006, and March, 2010."
PMC3266479,S9,,Intubated and mechanically ventilated patients (aged â‰¥16 years) within 72 h of ARDS onset were randomly assigned to receive either salbutamol (15 Î_g/kg ideal bodyweight per h) or placebo for up to 7 days.

PMC3266479,S11,,"All participants, caregivers, and investigators were masked to group allocation."
PMC3266479,S12,,The primary outcome was death within 28 days of randomisation.

PMC3266479,S15,,Findings
PMC3266479,S16,,We randomly assigned 162 patients to the salbutamol group and 164 to the placebo group.
PMC3266479,S17,,One patient in each group withdrew consent.
PMC3266479,S18,,Recruitment was stopped after the second interim analysis because of safety concerns.

PMC3266479,S20,,Interpretation
PMC3266479,S21,,Treatment with intravenous salbutamol early in the course of ARDS was poorly tolerated.

PMC3266479,S26,,Introduction
PMC3266479,S27,,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in about 14% of mechanically ventilated patients, and causes a mortality of 40â€“60%1â€“3 and a substantial reduction in survivors' quality of life.4â€“6"
PMC3266479,S28,,Î_-2 agonists could be a potential pharmacological intervention because they act on the many pulmonary cellular pathways thought to be associated with the pathophysiology of ARDS.
PMC3266479,S29,,"These drugs reduce neutrophil sequestration, activation, and production of inflammatory cytokines,7,8 and activate Î_-2 receptors on alveolar type-1 and type-2 cells, which increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, leading to increased sodium transport and acceleration of alveolar fluid reabsorption.9â€“11"
PMC3266479,S30,,"In patients with ARDS given salbutamol, we reported in-vivo evidence of reduced permeability of alveolar capillaries, and in-vitro evidence of enhanced wound repair in epithelial monolayers.12"
PMC3266479,S31,,"These data suggest that Î_-2 agonists could maintain alveolar-capillary integrity, thereby reducing alveolar flooding."
PMC3266479,S32,,"Findings from the Î_-agonist lung injury trial (BALTI)13â€”a single-centre, randomised controlled trial in 40 patients with ARDSâ€”showed that an infusion of salbutamol for 7 days caused significant reductions in extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure."
PMC3266479,S33,,"However, this trial was not designed to assess the potential effects on mortality."
PMC3266479,S34,,We therefore assessed whether treatment with salbutamol in the early course of ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.

PMC3266479,S96,,The RR for the primary outcome at this time was 1Â·55 (95% CI 1Â·07â€“2Â·24).
PMC3266479,S97,,"Therefore, the committee recommended suspension of recruitment to BALTI-2 because of a significant (p=0Â·02) adverse effect of salbutamol on 28-day mortality, and the 99Â·8% CI excluded a benefit for salbutamol of the size anticipated in the protocol."
PMC3266479,S98,,"Infusion was discontinued in all patients (one receiving salbutamol, two receiving placebo) receiving study drug at that time."

PMC3266479,S112,,"Patients in the salbutamol group were more likely to have their infusion stopped early than were those in the placebo group, either because of death (14/161 vs eight of 163), or the development of significant side-effects (47/161 vs 13/163)."

PMC3266479,S141,,Systematic review
PMC3266479,S142,,"We searched PubMed and The Cochrane Library from Jan 1, 1960, to Aug 31, 2011, for randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews investigating the use of Î_ agonists for the treatment of patients with established acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."
PMC3266479,S143,,"We used a combination of text (â€œsalbutamolâ€ù, â€œbeta agonistâ€ù, â€œARDSâ€ù) and medical subject headings terms (â€œadrenergic beta-agonistsâ€ù, â€œrespiratory distress syndromeâ€ù, â€œadultâ€ù)."
PMC3266479,S144,,"We identified two randomised controlled trials13,23 and no systematic reviews."
PMC3266479,S145,,"Both trials were at low risk of bias, according to the criteria of the Cochrane risk of bias method."
PMC3266479,S146,,The Î_-agonist lung injury trial (BALTI)13 recruited 40 patients and used an intravenous infusion of salbutamol.
PMC3266479,S147,,"Findings from the trial showed reductions in extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure in the group given salbutamol, but no difference in 28-day mortality (11 [58%] of 19 patients died in the salbutamol group vs 14 [67%] of 21 in the placebo group).12"
PMC3266479,S148,,The aerosolised beta-2 agonist for treatment of acute lung injury (ALTA)23 trial randomly assigned 282 patients with acute lung injury to receive aerosolised salbutamol (5 mg) or placebo.
PMC3266479,S149,,The trial was stopped early on grounds of futility.
PMC3266479,S150,,The number of ventilator-free days (salbutamol 14Â·4 days vs placebo 16Â·6 days; 95% CI for the difference âˆ’4Â·7 to 0Â·3 days; p=0Â·087) or hospital mortality (35 [23%] of 152 patients died in the salbutamol group vs 23 [17%] of 130 in the placebo group; 95% CI for the difference âˆ’4Â·0 to 14Â·7; p=0Â·30) did not differ significantly.
PMC3266479,S151,,Interpretation
PMC3266479,S152,,"The effects on ventilator-free days and mortality in ALTA were consistent with those in BALTI-2, but our trial shows clearly that intravenous administration of salbutamol at 15 Î_g/kg ideal bodyweight per h to patients with early ARDS was poorly tolerated, is unlikely to be beneficial, and could worsen outcomes."
PMC3266479,S153,,Routine use of Î_-2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS cannot be recommended.
PMC3266479,S154,,"Our findings show that intravenous salbutamol given to patients with early ARDS significantly increased 28-day mortality, and reduced ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days compared with those given placebo."
PMC3266479,S155,,"Treatment was poorly tolerated because of tachycardia, arrhythmias, and lactic acidosis."
PMC3266479,S156,,"These findings were unexpected; however, they have clarified whether intravenous infusion of Î_-2 agonists should be used in patients with ARDS (panel)."
PMC3266479,S157,,"The ALTA trial23 of aerolised salbutamol for treatment of acute lung injury in 282 patients was stopped because the primary endpoint, ventilator-free days, had crossed predefined futility boundaries, making the probability of a positive trial very low."
PMC3266479,S158,,"Nevertheless, in that trial, clinical outcomes were worse in the salbutamol group than in the placebo group, particularly in the most severely ill patients."
PMC3266479,S159,,"Because we recruited a large number of ARDS patients, with characteristics similar to other multicentre trials,2,23 from 46 multidisciplinary intensive-care units in the UK, our data could be generalised to other intensive-care units."
PMC3266479,S160,,Our trial has some limitations.
PMC3266479,S161,,"First, mortality in the placebo group was much lower than anticipated."
PMC3266479,S162,,This outcome could have been caused by changes in the mortality of ARDS because of improvements in treatments.24
PMC3266479,S163,,"Second, because of the nature of pragmatic trials, we did not obtain prospective data for cardiovascular comorbidity and causes of deaths, including results of post-mortem."
PMC3266479,S164,,These data could provide useful information about possible explanations of these unexpected trial results.
PMC3266479,S165,,"Third, the trial was stopped at a smaller sample size than was planned; therefore, the precision of the treatment effect estimates is lower than expected."
PMC3266479,S166,,"A large sample size and narrow CIs might clarify salbutamol's effects on secondary outcomes, such as mortality rates in intensive-care units and hospitals."
PMC3266479,S167,,"Fourth, although we recommended best practice for ARDS (protective ventilation, conservative fluid management), we did not measure details of clinical management."
PMC3266479,S168,,"We selected the dose of salbutamol (15 Î_g/kg ideal bodyweight per h) after an early dose-ranging study identified it to be the maximum dose that critically ill patients could receive without an increase in ventricular, atrial tachycardia, or ectopy."
PMC3266479,S169,,"This dose was used in the BALTI study25 and resulted in steady-state plasma concentrations of salbutamol (1Ã—10âˆ’6 M), and is associated with a 100% increase in clearance of basal alveolar fluid in animal studies of ARDS."
PMC3266479,S170,,"The dose is at the high end of the manufacturer's recommended dosing regimen; as such, a beneficial effect of salbutamol could have been outweighed by its adverse effects at this dose."
PMC3266479,S171,,"A lower dose of salbutamol might have produced a different outcome, so the conclusions from our study can relate only to the dose given."
PMC3266479,S172,,The mechanisms underlying the increased mortality in the salbutamol group remain unclear.
PMC3266479,S173,,"That the survival curves for salbutamol and placebo seem to continue to diverge after the end of the salbutamol infusion might be notable, so the mechanism could be complex."
PMC3266479,S174,,"The ALTA investigators23 explored possible explanations for the scarcity of effect of Î_-2 agonists, including poor drug delivery to injured and oedematous alveoli, inadequate alveolar epithelial response, downregulation of Î_-2 receptors, and genetic variation."
PMC3266479,S175,,"Adverse effects on the cardiovascular systemâ€”eg, tachyarrythmias, cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarctionâ€”could have been harmful.26,27"

PMC3321505,S2,,Double-Blind Randomized Trials of Single-Tablet Ibuprofen/High-Dose Famotidine vs. Ibuprofen Alone for Reduction of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers
PMC3321505,S3,,Abstract
PMC3321505,S4,,OBJECTIVES:
PMC3321505,S5,,We performed two 24-week double-blind trials (REDUCE-1 and -2 (Registration Endoscopic Studies to Determine Ulcer Formation of HZT-501 Compared with Ibuprofen: Efficacy and Safety Studies)) to assess whether double-dose famotidine given in a single-tablet combination with ibuprofen (HZT-501) significantly reduces gastric and duodenal ulcers as compared with ibuprofen.
PMC3321505,S6,,METHODS:
PMC3321505,S7,,"Patients (40â€“80 years) requiring daily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for â‰¥6 months with no prior ulcer complications, negative H. pylori stool test, and baseline endoscopy showing no ulcers and <5 erosions were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to HZT-501 or identical-appearing ibuprofen 800â€‰mg tablets thrice daily."
PMC3321505,S8,,"Study endoscopies were done at 8, 16, and 24 weeks."
PMC3321505,S9,,"After unblinding and initial analyses, 12 patients were found to be misclassified as having gastric ulcers based on the adjudication of endoscopy reports, and analyses were re-run."
PMC3321505,S10,,RESULTS:
PMC3321505,S11,,"In REDUCE-1, the primary end point analysis of gastric ulcers at 24 weeks with HZT-501 vs. ibuprofen was 12.7% vs. 22.9% (P=0.0044) in the post-adjudication analysis."
PMC3321505,S12,,"In REDUCE-2, the primary end point analysis of upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers was 13.0% vs. 20.5% (P=0.0587) in the post-adjudication analysis."
PMC3321505,S13,,Prespecified pooled analyses showed significantly fewer gastric (12.5% vs. 20.7%) and duodenal ulcers (1.1% vs. 5.1%) with HZT-501 vs. ibuprofen.
PMC3321505,S14,,"Proportional hazards analysis of multiple potential risk factors showed the risk ratio of upper GI ulcers with HZT-501 vs. ibuprofen was 0.46, 95% confidence interval was 0.34â€“0.61."
PMC3321505,S15,,CONCLUSIONS:
PMC3321505,S16,,"Combined results of the REDUCE studies indicate that double-dose famotidine plus ibuprofen, given as a combination tablet, decreases endoscopic upper GI ulcers as compared with ibuprofen alone."
PMC3321505,S17,,INTRODUCTION
PMC3321505,S18,,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used as analgesics (1,2)."
PMC3321505,S19,,"Ibuprofen is the most commonly used non-aspirin NSAID, with about one quarter of the US population aged 17 years or older reporting ibuprofen intake in the past month (2)."
PMC3321505,S20,,"The main factor that limits NSAID use is the development of upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects including ulcers, complications such as bleeding, and dyspepsia."
PMC3321505,S21,,"Strategies recommended (3,4,5,6) to decrease GI injury in NSAID users include co-therapy with misoprostol or proton-pump inhibitors and/or use of COX-2 selective inhibitors."
PMC3321505,S22,,"Histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have not been recommended for preventive therapy in NSAID users because, when given in standard doses, they significantly decrease duodenal but not gastric ulcers (3,7)."
PMC3321505,S23,,"However, a Cochrane systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials â‰¥3 months (7) identified one study showing a significant benefit of double-dose H2RAs in reducing both gastric ulcers (relative risk (RR)=0.42, 95% confidence interval, 0.18â€“0.97) and duodenal ulcers (RR=0.19, 0.04â€“0.85) (8)."
PMC3321505,S24,,The RRs for proton-pump inhibitor vs. placebo co-therapy in the meta-analysis were 0.40 (0.32â€“0.51) for gastric ulcers and 0.19 (0.09â€“0.37) for duodenal ulcers (7).
PMC3321505,S25,,"Although many national and international groups recommend protective therapy in NSAID users at increased risk of GI events (3,4,5,6), most such patients are not prescribed protective therapy (8,9)."
PMC3321505,S26,,"In addition, patients may not take their protective co-therapy along with their NSAID, especially if they are not experiencing any symptoms, and decreased adherence is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing upper GI ulcers or bleeding (10,11,12,13)."
PMC3321505,S27,,"For example, van Soest et al. (13) reported that the risk of an upper GI clinical event (bleeding, perforation, or symptomatic ulcer) in NSAID users at increased GI risk rose 16% for every 10% decrease in the proportion of time a proton-pump inhibitor or H2RA was prescribed."
PMC3321505,S28,,"Mechanisms that ensure adherence to protective therapy, such as the combination of an NSAID and a protective agent in one pill, theoretically should decrease the GI risk associated with the NSAID therapy."
PMC3321505,S29,,"We performed the REDUCE trials (Registration Endoscopic Studies to Determine Ulcer Formation of HZT-501 Compared with Ibuprofen: Efficacy and Safety Studies) to assess whether double-dose famotidine given in a single-tablet combination with ibuprofen (HZT-501 (ibuprofen 800â€‰mg plus famotidine 26.6â€‰mg); Horizon Pharma, Northbrook, IL) significantly reduces the proportion of patients who develop gastric ulcers (REDUCE-1) or upper GI (gastric or duodenal) ulcers (REDUCE-2) during 24 weeks of treatment as compared with ibuprofen in adult NSAID users."

PMC3321505,S77,,The trials continued until their planned completion based on the prespecified sample sizes.
PMC3321505,S78,,Selected baseline characteristics of the primary population analyzed in the two study groups for each trial are shown in Table 1.
PMC3321505,S79,,"Reason for NSAID use across both trials included pain (37.9%), osteoarthritis (50.6%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.5%), and other (7.8%)."
PMC3321505,S80,,The initial results after data lock and unblinding in REDUCE-1 for the primary end point of proportion of patients with gastric ulcers at 24 weeks was 12.9% for HZT-501 and 25.3% for ibuprofen (P=0.0009; NNT=11).
PMC3321505,S81,,The initial results for the primary end point in REDUCE-2 showed the proportions of patients with upper GI ulcers of 13.8% for HZT-501 and 22.6% for ibuprofen (P=0.0304; NNT=11).

PMC3321505,S83,,"After unblinding and performance of the statistical analyses, a review of endoscopy reports revealed that some patients with esophageal ulcers had been incorrectly assigned as having gastric ulcers."
PMC3321505,S84,,An adjudication committee of two independent gastroenterologists then reviewed all positive endoscopy reports to determine how many ulcers had been misclassified.
PMC3321505,S85,,"In the primary population, five patients in REDUCE-1 (one HZT-501 (no ulcer), four ibuprofen (four esophageal ulcers)) and seven patients in REDUCE-2 (three HZT-501 (two no ulcer, one esophageal ulcer), four ibuprofen (one no ulcer, three esophageal ulcers)) had esophageal ulcers misclassified as gastric ulcers or had no gastric ulcer present; duodenal ulcers were not affected."
PMC3321505,S86,,The results for the analyses were then re-run with these patients no longer listed as having gastric ulcers.

PMC3321505,S93,,Assessment of secondary end points in REDUCE-2 showed that the 6.7% reduction in life table estimate of gastric ulcers was not significant in the initial comparison (P=0.0795) and the 5.3% reduction in the post-adjudication analysis was not formally tested based on the predefined hierarchical testing sequence for the analysis.
PMC3321505,S94,,The combined trial cumulative incidence for crude rate of ulcers by visit is shown in Figure 2.

PMC3321505,S97,,"In addition, when the Cochranâ€“Mantelâ€“Haenszel analysis was re-run with study (REDUCE-1 or -2) included in the model, the P values for comparisons of all three end points remained <0.0001."
PMC3321505,S98,,The combined trial data of the primary population was used in a proportional hazards analysis to examine multiple risk factors in relation to development of upper GI ulcers.
PMC3321505,S99,,"Treatment with HZT-501 (vs. ibuprofen) was associated with a significantly lower risk ratio (RR) for upper GI ulcer formation in the initial (RR=0.44, 0.33â€“0.58) and post-adjudication analyses (RR=0.46, 0.34â€“0.61)."

PMC3321505,S101,,RRs of upper GI ulcer formation for low-dose aspirin use were 1.40 (0.97â€“2.02) for initial and 1.46 (1.004â€“2.11) for post-adjudication analyses and for prior ulcer history they were 1.55 (0.95â€“2.53) for initial and 1.65 (1.01â€“2.69) for post-adjudication analyses.

PMC3321505,S108,,No significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions were identified for the subgroups assessed (all P values >0.10).
PMC3321505,S109,,Only two adverse event terms were reported in either study at a rate of â‰¥5%: dyspepsia and nausea.
PMC3321505,S110,,The rates for HZT-501 vs. ibuprofen in the pooled results were 4.7% vs. 8.0% for dyspepsia and 5.8% vs. 4.7% for nausea.
PMC3321505,S111,,"However, the proportion of patients with one or more predefined symptoms consistent with dyspepsia was not significantly different between HZT-501 and ibuprofen (12.3% vs. 14.9%)."
PMC3321505,S112,,GI complications were reported by investigators for three patients (0.6%) given HZT-501 and zero given ibuprofen in REDUCE-1.
PMC3321505,S113,,"These were GI bleeding episodes in which hemoglobin dropped 1.6, 2.1, and 3.1â€‰g/dl without clinical evidence of overt GI bleeding, transfusions, or hospitalizations."
PMC3321505,S114,,Gastric erosions were noted at endoscopy in all three patients.
PMC3321505,S115,,No GI complications were reported in REDUCE-2.
PMC3321505,S116,,One death occurred in the two studies: a 48-year-old female in the ibuprofen group died of cardiorespiratory arrest and multiorgan system failure attributed to acetaminophen toxicity.
PMC3321505,S117,,DISCUSSION
PMC3321505,S118,,"The goal of the REDUCE trials was to confirm the results of a single smaller study by Taha et al. (15), and demonstrate a significant decrease in NSAID-associated gastric and duodenal ulcers with double-dose famotidine, using a combination tablet of ibuprofen and famotidine."
PMC3321505,S119,,"Two studies of identical design were performed, as is generally required when phase 3 trials are used to apply for regulatory approval."
PMC3321505,S120,,The trials differed only in their sample size and their primary vs. secondary end point (gastric ulcers followed by upper GI ulcers in REDUCE-1 and upper GI ulcers followed by gastric ulcers in REDUCE-2).
PMC3321505,S121,,"After unblinding and initial analyses were performed, it was discovered on adjudication of endoscopy reports that 12 patients listed as having gastric ulcers actually had esophageal ulcers or no ulcers."
PMC3321505,S122,,"Therefore, analyses were re-run using the post-adjudication data, with these 12 patients no longer listed as having gastric ulcers."
PMC3321505,S123,,The larger REDUCE-1 trial demonstrated a significant decrease in the primary end point of gastric ulcers (P=0.0044) as well as in duodenal ulcers.
PMC3321505,S124,,"The smaller REDUCE-2 trial did not show a significant difference in the post-adjudication primary analysis of life table estimates of upper GI ulcers, with a P value of 0.0587; the secondary statistical comparison of crude proportions of upper GI ulcers revealed a P value of 0.0070."
PMC3321505,S125,,"Pooled analysis of the trials showed a significant decrease in upper GI ulcers with an NNT of 11, as well as significant decreases in both components, gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers."
PMC3321505,S126,,"Multivariable analysis revealed a significant RR reduction in ulcers of âˆ_55% with HZT-501 after adjustment for risk factors that may influence the development of ulcers, such as age, ulcer history, aspirin use, and baseline erosions."
PMC3321505,S127,,"Furthermore, the treatment effect of HZT-501 was not significantly different in subgroups of patients with or without these characteristics."
PMC3321505,S128,,"Of interest, there was no decrement in treatment effect noted among patients taking low-dose aspirin."
PMC3321505,S129,,Ibuprofen was chosen as the NSAID studied because it is the most widely used non-aspirin NSAID in the United States (2).
PMC3321505,S130,,"Although famotidine is generally given twice daily, ibuprofen at full doses for arthritis is typically given thrice daily."
PMC3321505,S131,,The double-dose famotidine was therefore given as three daily doses of 26.6â€‰mg in the combination tablet.
PMC3321505,S132,,A preliminary study suggested that 26.6â€‰mg thrice daily produces gastric acid suppression similar to 40â€‰mg twice daily after 1 day (16).
PMC3321505,S133,,"Also, oral administration of HZT-501 is bioequivalent to concurrent oral administration of equivalent separate doses of ibuprofen and famotidine (17)."
PMC3321505,S134,,"Previous trials have suggested that H2RAs may decrease upper GI symptoms in patients taking NSAIDs (18,19)."
PMC3321505,S135,,We did not find a significant decrease in the proportion of patients spontaneously reporting a composite of symptoms consistent with dyspepsia.
PMC3321505,S136,,Future studies should formally assess NSAID users with a patient-reported outcome instrument validated for NSAID-associated dyspepsia.
PMC3321505,S137,,"Upper GI complications such as bleeding are more important clinically than ulcers identified at a scheduled endoscopy, although results of endoscopic ulcer trials in NSAID users generally correlate with results in outcome trials assessing upper GI complications (7,20)."
PMC3321505,S138,,"Nevertheless, our study was insufficient in size and duration to reasonably assess complications, and the results do not demonstrate a benefit in complications."
PMC3321505,S139,,"No patients had overt bleeding, obstruction, or perforation."
PMC3321505,S140,,"Two patients in the HZT-501 arms (and none in the ibuprofen arms) had asymptomatic hemoglobin decreases >2.0â€‰g/dl, the level typically used in outcome trials as a clinically relevant hemoglobin drop (21,22), and a third had a 1.6â€‰g/dl decrease."
PMC3321505,S141,,"Chan et al. (22) recently showed that such hemoglobin drops are much more common than overt complications in patients taking an NSAID plus antisecretory therapy, and that a majority are probably of small intestinal origin."
PMC3321505,S142,,"Our patients with hemoglobin drops had gastric erosions noted, although no examination was performed to assess potential small intestinal injury."
PMC3321505,S143,,Very few patients were on antiplatelet agents other than low-dose aspirin so our study is unable to assess any potential interactions of famotidine with clopidogrel.
PMC3321505,S144,,"Famotidine, like ranitidine and unlike cimetidine, shows little or no interaction with the hepatic cytochrome P450 system (23)."
PMC3321505,S145,,"In summary, the combined results of two studies indicate that double-dose famotidine plus ibuprofen, given as a combination tablet, decreases endoscopic upper GI ulcers as compared with ibuprofen alone."
PMC3321505,S146,,"Use of a combination tablet theoretically should improve adherence to antisecretory therapy as compared with use of separate individual NSAID and antisecretory agents, but future studies will be necessary to prospectively study adherence and the effect on endoscopic or clinical outcomes."

PMC3348565,S2,,Effect on the incidence of pneumonia of vitamin D supplementation by quarterly bolus dose to infants in Kabul: a randomised controlled superiority trial
PMC3348565,S3,,Summary
PMC3348565,S4,,Background
PMC3348565,S5,,"Vitamin D has a role in regulating immune function, and its deficiency is a suggested risk factor for childhood pneumonia."
PMC3348565,S6,,Our aim was to assess whether oral supplementation of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in a high-risk infant population.
PMC3348565,S7,,Methods
PMC3348565,S8,,"We did a randomised placebo-controlled trial to compare oral 100â€ˆ000 IU (2Â·5 mg) vitamin D3 with placebo given to children aged 1â€“11 months in Kabul, Afghanistan."
PMC3348565,S9,,Randomisation was by use of a computer-generated list.
PMC3348565,S10,,Vitamin D or placebo was given by fieldworkers once every 3 months for 18 months.
PMC3348565,S11,,Children presenting at the study hospital with signs of pneumonia had their diagnosis confirmed radiographically.
PMC3348565,S12,,Our primary outcome was the first or only episode of radiologically confirmed pneumonia.
PMC3348565,S13,,Our analysis was by intention to treat.
PMC3348565,S14,,"This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00548379."
PMC3348565,S15,,Findings
PMC3348565,S16,,1524 children were assigned to receive vitamin D3 and 1522 placebo.
PMC3348565,S17,,"There was no significant difference between the incidence of first or only pneumonia between the vitamin D (0Â·145 per child per year, 95% CI 0Â·129â€“0Â·164) and the placebo group (0.137, 0Â·121â€“0Â·155); the incidence rate ratio was 1Â·06 (95% CI 0Â·89â€“1Â·27)."
PMC3348565,S18,,"From 652 children during five separate periods of testing serum calcifediol, only one child in each of two testing periods had results greater than 375 nmol/L in the intervention groupâ€”a toxic level."
PMC3348565,S19,,Interpretations
PMC3348565,S20,,Quarterly bolus doses of oral vitamin D3 supplementation to infants are not an effective intervention to reduce the incidence of pneumonia in infants in this setting.

PMC3348565,S23,,Introduction
PMC3348565,S24,,Afghanistan has the third highest mortality of children younger than 5 years in the world (257 per 1000 livebirths); a leading cause of this is pneumonia.
PMC3348565,S25,,Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia1 and India2 suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children.
PMC3348565,S26,,Our systematic review identified one randomised placebo controlled trial3 relating pneumonia or lower respiratory infections to vitamin D deficiency supplementation in young children.
PMC3348565,S27,,This trial of 100â€ˆ000 IU (2Â·5 mg) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation along with antibiotic treatment of children younger than 3 years with clinically diagnosed pneumonia in Kabul showed no difference in the time to recovery between the groups.
PMC3348565,S28,,"However, the risk of repeated pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months was 13% (relative risk [RR] 0Â·78, 95% CI 0Â·64â€“0Â·94; p=0Â·01) lower in the vitamin D3 compared with the placebo group.3"
PMC3348565,S29,,Other more recent studies assessing different outcomes in children or adults have conflicting findings on the effectiveness of vitamin D.
PMC3348565,S30,,There is growing evidence of the vitamin D parancrine system enhancing innate immunity:4 the activation of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages by microbial pathogens results in increased expression of CYP27B1 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes within these cells.
PMC3348565,S31,,"In the presence of adequate concentrations of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), CYP27B1 leads to an increase synthesis of intracellular calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)."
PMC3348565,S32,,"The binding of this to vitamin D receptors in turn results in increased intracellular formation of antimicrobial compounds, such as cathelicidins.5"
PMC3348565,S33,,"The generation of intracellular antimicrobial compounds is impaired in patients who are vitamin D deficient (ie, low serum concentrations of calcifediol)."
PMC3348565,S34,,It has been suggested that vitamin D might be used in the treatment of opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant infections.
PMC3348565,S35,,There is debate between investigators regarding concentrations that relate to optimum stores of vitamin D in the body.
PMC3348565,S36,,"In children, serum calcifediol concentrations should be maintained at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater for skeletal benefits.6"
PMC3348565,S37,,"Vitamin D deficiency rickets in children younger than 5 years is an endemic problem in developing countries, ranging from 5â€“45%, even where sunlight is abundant,1,2,7,8 and has also re-emerged in some developed countries.7,9"
PMC3348565,S38,,"In people, the main source of vitamin D is through the action of ultraviolet B radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, with small amounts derived from dietary sources."
PMC3348565,S39,,"In Afghanistan, dietary intake of vitamin D is low10 and exposure of women to sunlight is limited by the widespread use of the burqa."
PMC3348565,S40,,"Therefore, breastmilk, a normally poor source of vitamin D,11 becomes even more deficient."
PMC3348565,S41,,"Furthermore, the common practice of swaddling infants might reduce exposure to sunlight.2"
PMC3348565,S42,,Thus young children are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency.
PMC3348565,S43,,A cross-sectional survey during the high-risk winter months in 2005 showed that greater than 95% of children younger than 5 years in a socioeconomically deprived part of Kabul had serum calcifediol levels of less than 37Â·5 nmol/L.12
PMC3348565,S44,,"On the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation,13,14 we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100â€ˆ000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population."
PMC3348565,S45,,"Our secondary hypotheses were that supplementation would reduce all pneumonias (radiologically confirmed or clinically defined), repeat episodes of pneumonia, hospital admissions, and all cause mortality."
PMC3348565,S46,,"We selected infants from inner-city Kabul because we knew the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency12 and incidence of pneumonia3,15 were high."

PMC3348565,S147,,Discussion
PMC3348565,S148,,"Our trial in a population known to be vitamin D deficient shows that 100â€ˆ000 IU (2Â·5 mg) of vitamin D3 supplementation once every 3 months did not affect the incidence or severity of childhood pneumonia, in this population."
PMC3348565,S149,,"Similarly, vitamin D3 supplementation did not affect hospital admissions and all-cause mortality."
PMC3348565,S150,,Our trial had a large sample size with a low loss to follow-up that remained within our sample size estimates.
PMC3348565,S151,,"The ascertainment of study outcomes was robust, and done clinically through masked experienced and retrained paediatricians with Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses clinical definitions of pneumonia applied in other trials18 and radiologically through the interpretation of chest radiographs by masked, experienced, and external readers by use of WHO standards."
PMC3348565,S152,,Frequent home visits confirmed outcomes of interest.
PMC3348565,S153,,Supplementation raised the serum concentration of calcifediol in the intervention group at several points in our study.
PMC3348565,S154,,Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation.
PMC3348565,S155,,"Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups."
PMC3348565,S156,,"However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown."
PMC3348565,S157,,"There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study."
PMC3348565,S158,,"Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.20"
PMC3348565,S159,,"We accounted for nutritional factors through a diet questionnaire, weight at recruitment, and growth comparison at the end of our studyâ€”any nutritional deficiencies would have been equally balanced between the two groups."
PMC3348565,S160,,"As with other studies, dietary calcium deficiency might have led to so-called wastage of body stores of vitamin D in both groups, affecting the maintenance of even higher vitamin D levels in the intervention group."

PMC3348565,S162,,"Furthermore, adult fracture-outcome supplementation studies21 show no benefit from adding calcium."
PMC3348565,S163,,A further limitation of our study is that it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation.

PMC3348565,S172,,We did not limit our searches by language or date.
PMC3348565,S173,,No studies reported on radiologically confirmed pneumonias.
PMC3348565,S174,,One masked placebo trial assessed the effect of bolus supplementation of vitamin D3 in a high-risk population clinically diagnosed with pneumonia (100â€ˆ000 IU [2Â·5 mg] vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol] supplementation along with antibiotic treatment to children younger than 3 years) in Kabul.
PMC3348565,S175,,Treatment had no effect on the time to recovery but reduced the risk of clinically defined pneumonia 13% up to 3 months after treatment.3
PMC3348565,S176,,"Trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women24 identified a reduction in self-reported episodes of infections during winter, whereas two other studies in adults did not identify effects on self-reported episodes."
PMC3348565,S177,,One trial in schoolchildren noted a 42% reduction in the risk of influenza A by use of antigen titre as a proxy measure.
PMC3348565,S178,,"The reported in-vitro and case-control studies suggest a link between respiratory infections and vitamin D as an immunoregulator, but the evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on acute respiratory infections is conflicting."
PMC3348565,S179,,"Given that pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in young children, the effects of vitamin D supplementation to infants on the incidence of pneumonia merits investigation."
PMC3348565,S180,,Interpretation
PMC3348565,S181,,Our findings show that bolus quarterly supplementation of 100â€ˆ000 IU vitamin D3 did not reduce the rate or severity of radiologically confirmed or clinically defined pneumonia.
PMC3348565,S182,,This finding is surprising in view of evidence suggesting an association between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory infections.
PMC3348565,S183,,"However, our findings are similar to some previous studies on the effect of supplementation on infections of the upper respiratory tract or other outcomes such as bone fractures, cancers, and heart disease, and they contribute to the debate on factors that determine the immunological effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation."
PMC3348565,S184,,"Our findings are at odds with smaller case-control hospital studies that show an enhanced rate of vitamin D deficiency or rickets in children with pneumonia and the increasing evidence suggesting that calcitriol, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, has an important role in the human immune system.4"
PMC3348565,S185,,"A systematic review of the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases had mixed findings, concluding that more rigorously designed clinical trials are needed (panel).25"
PMC3348565,S186,,No studies report the effect of vitamin D on radiologically confirmed pneumonias.
PMC3348565,S187,,"Other trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract also had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women26 identified reduced self-reported episodes of infection of the upper respiratory tract, specifically in winter, whereas two others in elderly24 and general adults27 did not identify a difference between the groups with regards to self-reported episodes."
PMC3348565,S188,,"One trial in schoolchildren28 (measuring influenza A antigen from swabs) found a statistically significant reduced incidence in the intervention group (RR 0Â·58, 95% CI 0Â·34â€“0Â·99)."
PMC3348565,S189,,The benefits of supplementation for tuberculosis are similarly unclear.
PMC3348565,S190,,"One paediatric trial showed 16% higher rates of tuberculosis symptom resolution,29 an adult trial showed 23% greater sputum conversion rate at 6 months,30 another trial showed 20% greater restriction of BCG-lux growth in blood,31 another trial found accelerated sputum conversion only in a certain genotype of the sample,20 whereas yet another found no significant difference in sputum conversion32 in the intervention compared with the placebo group."
PMC3348565,S191,,"Vitamin D is linked with other non-bone health outcomes, but the few completed and adequately powered trials assessing the effect of supplementation have mixed findings in improving outcomesâ€”ie, cancers, vascular disease, and diabetes."
PMC3348565,S192,,"As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined."
PMC3348565,S193,,"The optimum concentrations of vitamin D for adults and children6 are based on non-immunological and, mostly, bone outcomes."
PMC3348565,S194,,"An associated issue is that, after the start of our trial, speculations arose that high fluctuations of natural or supplemented vitamin D intake might be linked to negative outcomes."
PMC3348565,S195,,"These speculations relate two studies in which supplementation of a single large dose (300â€ˆ00033 or 500â€ˆ00023 IU) of vitamin D for reducing fractures in elderly women led to an increase in fractures, plus similar discrepancies in prostate cancer research with vitamin D.22"
PMC3348565,S196,,Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true.
PMC3348565,S197,,"If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with13,14 and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged <6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations."
PMC3348565,S198,,"Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5Â·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below âˆ’3)."
PMC3348565,S199,,"Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100â€ˆ000 IU vitamin D3 given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months.3"
PMC3348565,S200,,"The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor,5 which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals."
PMC3348565,S201,,"In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given."
PMC3348565,S202,,"Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis.20"
PMC3348565,S203,,"Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings."
PMC3348565,S204,,"As with the trials in the older children, giving higher doses of vitamin D,25,34 we too did not record any adverse effects associated with vitamin D supplementation."
PMC3348565,S205,,"However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects."
PMC3348565,S206,,"Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100â€ˆ000 IU of vitamin D3 has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0â€“9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D.16"
PMC3348565,S207,,"Furthermore, single intramuscular injection of three times this dose (300â€ˆ000 IU) was safe in treating nutritional rickets in 6â€“30-month-old children residing in lower socioeconomic regions of sunny Istanbul.35"
PMC3348565,S208,,"Higher than recommended doses of daily supplementation of vitamin D (500â€“1000 IU per day, adding up to 120â€ˆ000 IU over 3 months) plus additional milk fortified with vitamin D, has been shown not to induce an overload,13 including in infants starting with normal ranges of vitamin D, even when supplementation continued during the summer (in France) and when mothers had antenatal vitamin D supplementation.36"
PMC3348565,S209,,"It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/Lâ€”thought undesirably high.6"
PMC3348565,S210,,"Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation."
PMC3348565,S211,,The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.
PMC3348565,S212,,We have shown that a quarterly 100â€ˆ000 IU supplementation of vitamin D3 did not reduce the incidence of pneumonias in children living in regions with high vitamin D deficiency.
PMC3348565,S213,,"In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children."

PMC3386495,S4,,Background
PMC3386495,S5,,"Thrombolysis is of net benefit in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, who are younger than 80 years of age and are treated within 4Â·5 h of onset."
PMC3386495,S6,,The third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) sought to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit up to 6 h from stroke onset.
PMC3386495,S7,,Methods
PMC3386495,S8,,"In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-treatment trial, patients were allocated to 0Â·9 mg/kg intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or to control."
PMC3386495,S9,,"The primary analysis was of the proportion of patients alive and independent, as defined by an Oxford Handicap Score (OHS) of 0â€“2 at 6 months."
PMC3386495,S10,,"The study is registered, ISRCTN25765518."
PMC3386495,S11,,Findings
PMC3386495,S12,,3035 patients were enrolled by 156 hospitals in 12 countries.
PMC3386495,S13,,"All of these patients were included in the analyses (1515 in the rt-PA group vs 1520 in the control group), of whom 1617 (53%) were older than 80 years of age."
PMC3386495,S14,,"At 6 months, 554 (37%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 534 (35%) in the control group were alive and independent (OHS 0â€“2; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1Â·13, 95% CI 0Â·95â€“1Â·35, p=0Â·181; a non-significant absolute increase of 14/1000, 95% CI âˆ’20 to 48)."
PMC3386495,S15,,"An ordinal analysis showed a significant shift in OHS scores; common OR 1Â·27 (95% CI 1Â·10â€“1Â·47, p=0Â·001)."
PMC3386495,S16,,"Fatal or non-fatal symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 104 (7%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 16 (1%) in the control group (adjusted OR 6Â·94, 95% CI 4Â·07â€“11Â·8; absolute excess 58/1000, 95% CI 44â€“72)."
PMC3386495,S17,,"More deaths occurred within 7 days in the rt-PA group (163 [11%]) than in the control group (107 [7%], adjusted OR 1Â·60, 95% CI 1Â·22â€“2Â·08, p=0Â·001; absolute increase 37/1000, 95% CI 17â€“57), but between 7 days and 6 months there were fewer deaths in the rt-PA group than in the control group, so that by 6 months, similar numbers, in total, had died (408 [27%] in the rt-PA group vs 407 [27%] in the control group)."
PMC3386495,S18,,Interpretation
PMC3386495,S19,,"For the types of patient recruited in IST-3, despite the early hazards, thrombolysis within 6 h improved functional outcome."

PMC3386495,S24,,"Each year, about 22 million people have a stroke world-wide,1,2 of whom 4 million reside in high-income countries,3,4 where thrombolytic therapy is affordable and feasible."
PMC3386495,S25,,"The burden of ischaemic stroke among the elderly is large and increasing;2,5 and we estimate that annually ischaemic stroke affects about a million people older than 80 years of age in high-income countries and about 3 million in low-income and middle-income countries."
PMC3386495,S26,,"Thrombolytic therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), when approved in Europe, was restricted to the treatment of patients younger than 80 years of age with acute ischaemic stroke who could be treated within 3 h."
PMC3386495,S27,,"A Cochrane systematic review of the 11 completed trials of thrombolysis (including 3977 patients) with intravenous rt-PA for acute ischaemic stroke showed that treatment was associated with a significant increase in survival free of disability, despite an early 3% excess of fatal intracranial haemorrhage.6"
PMC3386495,S28,,The review also suggested that treatment might be beneficial up to 6 h.6
PMC3386495,S29,,"An individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of intravenous rt-PA trials further showed that the earlier treatment was given, the greater the chance of a favourable outcome.7"
PMC3386495,S30,,"Older people have been under-represented in stroke trials in general,8 and in stroke thrombolysis trials in particular (only 79 people aged older than 80 years had been included in trials of rt-PA).6"
PMC3386495,S31,,"As a result of the current European Union (EU) approval criteria, treatment is only applicable to a small proportion of patients with acute stroke.9"
PMC3386495,S32,,"The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), therefore, had the following objectives: to establish the balance of benefits and harms of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in patients who did not exactly meet the licence criteria (especially elderly patients); determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit from this treatment; assess which categories of patients were most likely to benefit by investigating possible interactions between treatment effect and various factors (including age, stroke severity, and early brain imaging results); refine current estimates of the duration of the therapeutic time window; and to improve the external validity and precision of the existing estimates of the overall treat-ment effects (benefits and harms)."
PMC3386495,S33,,"The primary trial hypothesis was that 0Â·9 mg/kg rt-PA (maximum 90 mg) given to adult patients of all ages with acute ischaemic stroke, within 6 h of symptom onset, increased the proportion of people who were alive and independent at 6 months."

PMC3386495,S167,,The subgroup analyses for a specific factor provide estimated effects within sub-categories that adjust for such imbalances.
PMC3386495,S168,,"Overall, little variation occurred in the adjusted effects of treatment in different subgroups."
PMC3386495,S169,,"However, a significant difference did occur in the adjusted effect of treatment between patients older than 80 years and in patients 80 years or younger (p=0Â·027), suggesting greater benefit in those older than 80 years of age; contrary to expectations.14"
PMC3386495,S170,,Treatment appeared at least as effective in this age group as in younger patients.
PMC3386495,S171,,Significant trends towards larger effects of treatment in more severe strokes were also seen (as assessed by the NIHSS and by the predicted probability of a poor outcome18).
PMC3386495,S172,,"Benefit was greatest in patients treated within 3 h, but there was insufficient power to examine decay of benefit with time."
PMC3386495,S173,,"An analysis of the treatment effect in each of three equal-sized cohorts of patients (ie, those recruited in 2000â€“06, 2007â€“08, 2009â€“11) did not provide any evidence of period effects (data not shown)."
PMC3386495,S174,,"We also undertook a sensitivity analysis restricted to the 2939 (96%) patients with known 6-month vital and disability status (appendix pp 4â€“5), and the results were not qualitatively different from those in table 2."
PMC3386495,S175,,Discussion
PMC3386495,S176,,"Although the increase in the number of patients treated with rt-PA who were alive and independent at 6 months was smaller than originally anticipated and was not significant, the secondary analysis provides supportive evidence of benefit."
PMC3386495,S177,,"The ordinal analysis provided evidence that on average, patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis up to 6 h after stroke survived with less disability."
PMC3386495,S178,,"At 6 months, vital status was known for most patients and there was no evidence of any difference in the number of deaths, despite the excess of deaths within 7 days of stroke (mainly due to intracranial haemorrhage)."
PMC3386495,S179,,"Since mortality at 6 months was equal in the two groups, and in view of the evidence that the lower the patients' degree of disability at 6 months, the greater their subsequent survival,31 long-term follow-up beyond 6 months is important."
PMC3386495,S180,,"Follow-up for survival, therefore, continues in the UK, Norway, and Sweden to assess whether an overall survival advantage from rt-PA after 6 months emerges."
PMC3386495,S181,,"Since we sought to recruit older patients and patients who did not strictly meet prevailing licence criteria for thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, we anticipated a higher risk of adverse events, chiefly symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage."
PMC3386495,S182,,"The patient information leaflet stated that rt-PA treatment might be associated with an increased risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage of 4%, which indeed was the rate reported in the trial."
PMC3386495,S183,,"Furthermore, applying a similar definition of symptomatic intra-cerebral haemorrhage as in the Cochrane systematic review, the frequency of this disorder within 7 days in IST-3 patients treated with rt-PA (6Â·8%) was comparable with the 7Â·3% reported in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke (SITS) registry of 6483 patients treated within licence in routine clinical practice.32"
PMC3386495,S184,,"We also expected a higher risk of death in the control group, and a smaller proportion alive and independent than in previous trials."
PMC3386495,S185,,"Reassuringly, despite the different event rates in the control group, for most of the outcomes, there was no clear evidence that the effects of treatment were qualitatively different in IST-3 to those seen in earlier randomised trials, with two exceptions."
PMC3386495,S186,,We identified significant trends towards larger effects of treatment in patients with more severe strokes.
PMC3386495,S187,,"We also anticipated a reduction in fatal and non-fatal neurological deterioration due to swelling of the initial infarct,6 so the clear 17 per 1000 excess was unexpected, and inconsistent with data from previous trials.6"
PMC3386495,S188,,"As proposed by Kent and colleagues,33 we reported the effect of treatment on the primary outcome in several prespecified subgroups and included the effects sub-divided by the result of a prognostic score."
PMC3386495,S189,,"Benefit with treatment was greatest within 3 h, but the analyses did not have sufficient power to define the shape of the relation between benefit and time beyond 3 h."
PMC3386495,S190,,The effect of treatment in patients older than 80 years of age was at least as large as in patients younger than 80 years of age.
PMC3386495,S191,,A formal test for trend showed a significant difference for greater benefit of rt-PA in patients with increasingly severe strokes.
PMC3386495,S192,,"However, in view of the overall non-significant benefit for the primary outcome, the significant interactions across subgroups in these analyses should be interpreted with caution."
PMC3386495,S193,,"As specified in the statistical analysis plan, we planned additional secondary analyses to explore these apparent effects on the primary outcome (and on other outcomes, such as symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage) and to decide if these effects were due to chance."
PMC3386495,S194,,Panel
PMC3386495,S195,,Research in context
PMC3386495,S196,,Systematic review
PMC3386495,S197,,"To update the published systematic review of randomised-controlled trials of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and incorporate the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) results,6 we searched for additional randomised trials of intravenous rt-PA versus control within 6 h of onset of acute ischaemic stroke up to March 30, 2012, in the Cochrane Stroke Trials Registry (November, 2011), Internet Stroke Trials Centre (March, 2011), Medline and Embase (search strategy available on request), and references lists in review articles and conference abstracts."
PMC3386495,S198,,The primary analysis was for all patients treated up to 6 h after stroke.
PMC3386495,S199,,Data were available for 7012 patients in 12 trials.
PMC3386495,S200,,We tested for heterogeneity between the estimates of effect for key outcomes from two strata: all trials before IST-3 and IST-3.
PMC3386495,S201,,"The tests for heterogeneity in the proportional effects of treatment across these two strata were not significant for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (Ï‡2 2Â·13, p=0Â·1), deaths within 7 days (Ï‡2 1Â·44, p=0Â·2), deaths by the end of follow-up (Ï‡2 1Â·0, p=0Â·3) and, the proportion alive and independent (modified Rankin score 0â€“2: Ï‡2 3Â·08, p=0Â·08)."
PMC3386495,S202,,"Similarly, no heterogeneity occurred across the two strata for patients of all ages treated within 3 h (Ï‡2 0Â·25, p=0Â·6)."
PMC3386495,S203,,The review established that the effects of treatment reported in IST-3â€”in this wider range of patients (generally outside the current approvals)â€”were consistent with those seen in previous trials.
PMC3386495,S204,,Interpretation
PMC3386495,S205,,"By providing estimates on the benefits and harms of treating patients with acute ischaemic stroke outside the current approvals, IST-3 enables clinicians to consider thrombolytic treatment for a wider range of patients, especially those older than 80 years of age."
PMC3386495,S206,,The data reinforce the need for further efforts to increase the proportion of all ischaemic strokes treated within 3 h.
PMC3386495,S207,,The additional data from IST-3 give greater confidence that mortality is not increased by treatment.
PMC3386495,S208,,"The implications for ongoing research are that the data strengthen the rationale for the ongoing trials of thrombolysis in patients presenting more than 4Â·5 h after onset of stroke, and suggest that the imposition of upper age limits on future trials in acute stroke will become harder to justify."
PMC3386495,S209,,"Lyden34 has identified limitations in these data, chiefly that IST-3 recruited only half the number of patients originally intended and so was underpowered for the primary outcome (and more so for the subgroup analyses)."
PMC3386495,S210,,The many changes in the regulatory environment over the course of the trial delayed the approval of the trial in many centres and precluded the participation of several countries and hence was a significant factor in our failing to achieve our original target.11
PMC3386495,S211,,"Nonetheless, the trial was the largest-ever trial of thrombolysis therapy for stroke34 (over three times larger than any previous trial) and included more patients treated within 3 h of stroke (n=849) than were included in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial (n=624), the only previous trial examining specifically treatment within 3 h (panel)."
PMC3386495,S212,,"The fact that most of the IST-3 patients treated within 3 h were older than 80 years of age (n=726), yet achieved similar benefit to younger patients in NINDS trial, adds to the NINDS trial."
PMC3386495,S213,,The absence of masking is most relevant for the assessment of the events within 7 days.
PMC3386495,S214,,"However, every possible precaution was taken to ensure masking of the expert panel assessing the scans, and the adjudication committee, who also assessed clinical data on all potential cerebral events."
PMC3386495,S215,,"The proportional effect of treatment on fatal and non-fatal events within 7 days was very similar, which perhaps suggest that masking of the assessors was successful."
PMC3386495,S216,,The self-assessment at 6 months by patients or their carer by postal questionnaire or masked telephone interview was unmasked and so could be subject to reporting bias.34
PMC3386495,S217,,"However, self-reported outcome by patients is necessarily subjective and affected by many things besides knowledge of treatment allocation."
PMC3386495,S218,,The subgroup analysis subdivided by trial phase provides some reassurance in that no significant difference was seen in the effect of treatment on the primary outcome in the double-blind phase and the open phase (figure 3).
PMC3386495,S219,,The measurement of outcome with OHS at 6 months is different from previous trials that measured the modified Rankin score at 3 months.
PMC3386495,S220,,"When we planned IST-3 in 1998, the modified Rankin score and OHS were judged to be equivalent."
PMC3386495,S221,,"Both are derivatives of the original Rankin scale, developed by members of our group."
PMC3386495,S222,,"While the proportion of patients recorded as dependent might be slightly different with each scale, the choice of outcome scale would not bias the assessment of treatment effect between treatment and control groups."
PMC3386495,S223,,"The outcome was recorded at 6 months and 18 months, to assess the effects on survival free of disability after a few months and also in the long term (the longer the benefit persists, the greater the cost-effectiveness)."
PMC3386495,S224,,The longer time to follow-up allowed any differential effect of rt-PA on early and late death to become clearer.
PMC3386495,S225,,"Outcome (other than survival) was not recorded at 3 months, although the proportional effects on death and disability seen at 6 months in IST-3 are comparable with those seen at 3 months in previous trials."
PMC3386495,S226,,"Lyden also comments that the sampling approach to monitoring in IST-3 was less intense than in many commercial studies, and is a potential concern, but also states: â€œmany clinical trialists believe that source verification of some clinical trial data assures safety, accuracy, and validity of the trial data."
PMC3386495,S227,,"Authorities do not agree on the minimum quantity of verified data to assure validity (100%, half, 10% sample)â€_but there is no evidence to suggest any problems with the [IST-3] data set due to limited monitoring.â€ù34"
PMC3386495,S228,,"When the results of IST-3 are incorporated into an updated systematic review,35 the estimates of relative treatment effect are broadly compatible with the previous rt-PA trials for each of the main outcomes: alive and independent; death at final follow-up; and fatal intracranial haemorrhage."
PMC3386495,S229,,"Our trial was underpowered to reliably detect important subgroup effects, and so a collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis (the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists Collaboration [STTC]) has been established, which will include data from all the completed intravenous rt-PA trials and will update the previous pooled analysis.7"
PMC3386495,S230,,"The meta-analysis will explore which baseline factors, other than time, might modify the effects of treatment on major outcomes (such as death, functional outcome, and intracerebral haemorrhage), and so provide better guidance for clinicians and patients to apply this treatment as effectively as possible in routine practice."
PMC3386495,S231,,"For the types of patient recruited in IST-3 (about three quarters of whom were randomised after 3 h, and half of all patients were older than 80 years of age), by 6 months there was evidence that rt-PA improved functional outcome."
PMC3386495,S232,,"The data add weight to the policy of treating patients as soon as possible, and also justify extending treatment to patients older than 80 years of age."
PMC3386495,S233,,The data do not support any restriction of treatment on the basis of stroke severity or the presence of early ischaemic change on the baseline brain scan.
PMC3386495,S234,,The data support the need for randomised trials of thrombolysis in selected patients more than 4Â·5 h after stroke.

PMC3391717,S2,,Magnesium for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (MASH-2): a randomised placebo-controlled trial
PMC3391717,S3,,Summary
PMC3391717,S4,,Background
PMC3391717,S5,,Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia.
PMC3391717,S6,,We did a trial to test whether magnesium therapy improves outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717,S7,,Methods
PMC3391717,S8,,"We did this phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled trial in eight centres in Europe and South America."
PMC3391717,S9,,"We randomly assigned (with computer-generated random numbers, with permuted blocks of four, stratified by centre) patients aged 18 years or older with an aneurysmal pattern of subarachnoid haemorrhage on brain imaging who were admitted to hospital within 4 days of haemorrhage, to receive intravenous magnesium sulphate, 64 mmol/day, or placebo."
PMC3391717,S10,,We excluded patients with renal failure or bodyweight lower than 50 kg.
PMC3391717,S11,,"Patients, treating physicians, and investigators assessing outcomes and analysing data were masked to the allocation."
PMC3391717,S12,,"The primary outcome was poor outcomeâ€”defined as a score of 4â€“5 on the modified Rankin Scaleâ€”3 months after subarachnoid haemorrhage, or death."
PMC3391717,S13,,We analysed results by intention to treat.
PMC3391717,S14,,We also updated a previous meta-analysis of trials of magnesium treatment for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717,S15,,This study is registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 68742385) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2006-003523-36).

PMC3391717,S26,,"Prognosis after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is poor; case fatality after 1 month is 27â€“44% andâ€”although case fatality seems to have decreased over the past 10 yearsâ€”20% of survivors cannot live independently.1,2"
PMC3391717,S27,,"Delayed cerebral ischaemia occurs usually between 4 to 10 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, and is an important cause of poor outcome.3,4"
PMC3391717,S28,,"Because of the interval between the onset of haemorrhage and the onset of cerebral ischaemia, outcome might be improved with treatments to prevent ischaemia.3"

PMC3391717,S123,,Systematic review
PMC3391717,S124,,"We updated our previous Cochrane review5 with articles indexed by Medline before Jan 31, 2012."
PMC3391717,S125,,We also searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (up to April 2006) and Embase (up to March 2006) for randomised controlled trials comparing magnesium sulphate versus control in addition to nimodipine.
PMC3391717,S126,,We then searched the reference lists of identified articles and contacted stroke investigators for details of other published and unpublished studies.
PMC3391717,S127,,"Two reviewers (SDMD and AA, WMvdB, or GJER) independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality based on masking, outcome, type of analysis, and loss to follow-up."
PMC3391717,S128,,We excluded studies without control groups and those that were open-label.
PMC3391717,S129,,We contacted investigators to obtain missing information.
PMC3391717,S130,,The results of our meta-analysis showed no difference between groups.
PMC3391717,S131,,Interpretation
PMC3391717,S132,,"Randomised trials have suggested that magnesium is beneficial, but this finding was not reproduced in MASH 2.5"
PMC3391717,S133,,"Previous studies were much smaller than MASH 2, and were not adequately powered, so the results might have been due to chance and might have been subject to publication bias."
PMC3391717,S134,,"A randomised controlled trial of magnesium for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhageâ€”published when our study was still ongoingâ€”was also neutral, but did not have enough power to definitely rule out an effect.20"
PMC3391717,S135,,"The MASH 2 trial is the first adequately powered randomised controlled trial that shows no beneficial effect of magnesium on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is confirmed by our meta-analysis (figure 4).18â€“20"
PMC3391717,S136,,"Results from MASH 2 alone, and in combination with the other trial data (panel), show that intravenous magnesium does not affect outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage."
PMC3391717,S137,,Subgroup analyses did not identify a subgroup of patients who might benefit from magnesium treatment.
PMC3391717,S138,,Various explanations exist for magnesium not improving outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
PMC3391717,S139,,"First, the putative pathophysiological mechanisms leading to delayed cerebral ischaemia and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, which are targeted by magnesium treatment,6,9 might not be as important as other mechanisms that are not known to be affected by magnesium (eg, immediate ischaemia at the time of haemorrhage22)."
PMC3391717,S140,,"Second, magnesium is not known to affect other complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage that affect outcome, including hydrocephalus, rebleeding, electrolyte disturbances, hyperglycaemia, and cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction.23"
PMC3391717,S141,,"Third, intravenously administered magnesium does not seem to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier well."
PMC3391717,S142,,Doubling serum magnesium leads to only an 11â€“21% increase in magnesium concentration in cerebrospinal fluid.24
PMC3391717,S143,,"However, higher serum magnesium concentrations might cause systemic complications."
PMC3391717,S144,,Higher concentrations of magnesium in the subarachnoid space can be achieved by intracisternal infusion instead of intravenous infusions.
PMC3391717,S145,,"This route of administration leads to intracranial vasodilatation but requires invasive techniques with cisternal and lumbar drains, which have higher risks of complication.25"
PMC3391717,S146,,"Finally, vasodilation of cerebral arteries by magnesium does not necessarily prevent delayed cerebral ischaemia and improve outcome, since vasoconstriction is not the only cause of delayed cerebral ischaemia.26"
PMC3391717,S147,,Our trial has several strengths.
PMC3391717,S148,,"The trial included many patients, was masked, and more than 99% of patients were followed up for assessment of a clinically relevant outcome."
PMC3391717,S149,,The treatment that the participants received is probably representative of care for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in middle-income to high-income countries.
PMC3391717,S150,,"A substantial number of patients with poor clinical condition at admission were included, which also adds to the generalisibility of our results."
PMC3391717,S151,,We have shown that a telephone interview is a reliable way of measuring the modified Rankin score in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.27
PMC3391717,S152,,"A limitation of our study is that we collected key baseline and outcome data, but did not call patients back for study visits for detailed assessment of quality of life."
PMC3391717,S153,,"Because our study was pragmatically designed to assess whether magnesium improved clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, we chose poor outcome as our primary outcome measure."
PMC3391717,S154,,"Delayed cerebral haemorrhage is only a surrogate or explanatory outcome measure, and so we did not include delayed cerebral haemorrhage as a secondary outcome."
PMC3391717,S155,,"For the same reason, we did not include other baseline measurements such as amount of blood in CT scan or systemic illness, nor did we do close on-site monitoring."
PMC3391717,S156,,"Furthermore, we do not have complete information about adherence to study medication."
PMC3391717,S157,,"We did not require magnesium concentration to be routinely checked, in view of the results of our dose-finding and safety studies.13,14"
PMC3391717,S158,,"We cannot exclude the possibility of unmasking of investigators by checking patients' serum magnesium concentrations, although such unmasking will not have affected the primary or secondary outcome data, which were collected centrally by masked personnel."
PMC3391717,S159,,An effect of magnesium treatment on cognitive symptomsâ€”which are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage28â€”might have been missed by the modified Rankin Scale.
PMC3391717,S160,,"We measured clinical outcome 3 months after haemorrhage, which is a usual period for outcome assessment in stroke studies, and although a benefit might be detected later, we consider it unlikely in view of the probable mechanism of action of magnesium in the acute period after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage."
PMC3391717,S161,,"Magnesium has been studied in patients with ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage in the IMAGES trial,29 which included almost 2600 patients, but did not show a beneficial effect on outcome."
PMC3391717,S162,,"In the IMAGES trial, median time from symptom onset to treatment was 7 h (only 3% of patients were treated within 3 h), which might be too long after ischaemic damage for a neuroprotective effect."
PMC3391717,S163,,"In our study, median time to treatment was 33 h in the magnesium group, which is similar to the median time in MASH 1 (28 h).10"
PMC3391717,S164,,"In the same way, time to treatment with magnesium in MASH 2 might not have been short enough to ameliorate acute ischaemic injury and prevent delayed cerebral ischaemia because the initiation of the cascade leading to secondary injury might be irreversible."
PMC3391717,S165,,The MASH 2 trial has implications for clinical practice.
PMC3391717,S166,,Administration of magnesium after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is standard practice in many centres.
PMC3391717,S167,,"On the basis of the results of MASH 2â€”a trial of treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with sufficient power to detect a clinically significant improvement in outcomeâ€”and in combination with data from other trials, we do not recommend routine use of intravenous magnesium 64 mmol/day for the improvement of outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage."

PMC3420230,S9,,"Interventions Ursodeoxycholic acid 500 mg twice daily or placebo increased as necessary for symptomatic or biochemical improvement until delivery; early term delivery (induction or delivery started between 37+0 and 37+6) or expectant management (spontaneous labour awaited until 40 weeksâ€™ gestation or caesarean section undertaken by normal obstetric guidelines, usually after 39 weeksâ€™ gestation)."
PMC3420230,S10,,Main outcome measures The primary outcome for ursodeoxycholic acid was maternal itch (arithmetic mean of measures (100 mm visual analogue scale) of worst itch in past 24 hours) and for the timing of delivery was caesarean section.
PMC3420230,S11,,Secondary outcomes were other maternal and perinatal outcomes and recruitment rates.
PMC3420230,S12,,"Results Ursodeoxycholic acid reduced itching by âˆ’16 mm (95% confidence interval âˆ’27 mm to âˆ’6 mm), less than the 30 mm difference prespecified by clinicians and women as clinically meaningful."

PMC3420230,S24,,Introduction
PMC3420230,S25,,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (obstetric cholestasis) is characterised by pruritus, otherwise unexplained deranged liver enzyme levels, and elevated levels of serum bile acid.1"
PMC3420230,S26,,The itching typically subsides almost immediately after delivery and the serum bile acid and liver enzyme levels normalise within a few weeks.2
PMC3420230,S27,,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually presents in the late second and third trimester3 although it has been reported as early as 6-10 weeksâ€™ gestation.4
PMC3420230,S28,,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy affects about 0.7% of pregnancies in the United Kingdom, varying by ethnic group,5 and usually runs a relatively benign course."
PMC3420230,S29,,"The condition is associated with increased rates of spontaneous preterm labour, antepartum passage of meconium, and asphyxial events, but its relation to perinatal mortality is uncertain; early studies reported an increased risk of stillbirth, but some recent studies have cast doubt on the magnitude of the increased risk.1"
PMC3420230,S30,,"Interpretation has been complicated by lack of consistency in diagnostic criteria, the impact of drug treatment and elective delivery, and more general reductions in perinatal mortality from improved obstetric care."
PMC3420230,S31,,"Many obstetricians in the United Kingdom6 and worldwide7 treat intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy with ursodeoxycholic acid to reduce itching and hepatic impairment, although these outcomes have not been proved in a large trial and neither has fetal benefit or safety been tested adequately."
PMC3420230,S32,,The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistsâ€™ guidelines in use at the start of our trial stated that â€œThere are insufficient data to support the widespread use of ursodeoxycholic acid outside of clinical trials.
PMC3420230,S33,,"Women should be aware of the lack of robust data concerning improvement in pruritus, protection against stillbirth and safety to the fetus or neonate.â€ù8"
PMC3420230,S34,,"In the absence of any other drug treatment, however, ursodeoxycholic acid seems to be the favoured drug of choice; many pregnant women are treated each year in the United Kingdom6 and the drug is used worldwide for this condition."
PMC3420230,S35,,Elective delivery around 37-38 weeksâ€™ gestation is also widely practised on the assumption that it might pre-empt stillbirths.9
PMC3420230,S36,,"The current literature on fetal death in relation to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is based on case reports, small case series, and a larger series retrospectively recruited through a patient organisation10 that indicated that most fetal deaths occurred at later gestations (â‰¥34 weeks)."
PMC3420230,S37,,"Timed delivery, when the obstetrician believes that the risks of early delivery are less than those of awaiting labour, has been evaluated by randomised trials in many other maternal-fetal conditions, including growth restriction,11 12 pre-eclampsia,13 and preterm14 and term15 rupture of membranes but never in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy."
PMC3420230,S38,,"Despite this, 88% of maternity units in the United Kingdom practise induction of labour at 37-38 weeks in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.6"
PMC3420230,S39,,"Possible benefits to the baby of early term delivery before 38 weeksâ€™ gestation (a reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes such as asphyxial events or stillbirth associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy beyond 38 weeks) need to be balanced against the potential harms (an increase in respiratory morbidity16 or longer term indices such as special education needs17 and measures of general health, hospital admissions, and longstanding illness18)."
PMC3420230,S40,,The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines concluded that â€œObstetricians should be aware that there are insufficient data to support or refute the popular practice of â€˜earlyâ€™ (37 weeks of gestation) induction of labour aimed at reducing late stillbirth.â€ù8
PMC3420230,S41,,The United States lacks a specific guideline on timing of delivery in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
PMC3420230,S42,,"Both interventions (ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo and early term delivery versus expectant management) need to be evaluated in an adequately powered randomised controlled trial, preferably based on an appropriate perinatal outcome to assess fetal benefit or harm."
PMC3420230,S43,,"As some obstetricians routinely used ursodeoxycholic acid and early term delivery to treat women with pruritus and raised alanine transaminase levels (but normal bile acids levels), we included this group at the cliniciansâ€™ discretion."
PMC3420230,S44,,"We were, however, uncertain whether obstetricians would be willing to recruit women to such a trial or if the women (across the spectrum of disease severity) would want to participate."
PMC3420230,S45,,It was also unclear whether participants randomised to early or delayed delivery would comply with the trial allocation.
PMC3420230,S46,,"Given the uncertainty in the literature over adverse fetal outcomes in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, we had no adequate contemporaneous data for severe perinatal morbidity and mortality on which to base a power calculation and needed these to plan the main trial with sufficient robustness."
PMC3420230,S47,,"We therefore planned a semifactorial trial, testing both interventions in two stages: an initial phase where we would measure recruitment rate (in total, and related to disease severity), acceptability of randomisation among potential participants offered trial entry, adherence with each treatment arm, and completeness of outcome data."
PMC3420230,S48,,Recruitment would continue from the initial phase of the trial without unblinding of the randomisation code and with all participants contributing to the final outcome data.

PMC3420230,S228,,"Early term delivery in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is not associated with an increase in incidence of caesarean section, but the numbers are too small to exclude a possible rise."
PMC3420230,S229,,"The trial has also shown that recruitment is feasible for women across the spectrum of disease severity in a range of different types of hospitals from the United Kingdom, and that self reported adherence within the drug and placebo comparison and completeness of outcome data are high, so a large trial comparing ursodeoxycholic acid with placebo is feasible."
PMC3420230,S230,,"Participants, or their obstetricians, were less likely to comply with trial allocation in the expectant management arm of the timing of delivery comparison, although this is obscured by possible obstetric indications for delivery."

PMC3420230,S234,,"As the study was carried out in nine maternity units of varying types (teaching and non-teaching hospitals, inner city and district hospital), sizes, and location, the results are likely to be generalisable to maternity units in the United Kingdom and to other similar populations."
PMC3420230,S235,,"We are confident in the conclusion that ursodeoxycholic acid reduces pruritus, although having predetermined a clinically meaningful difference by survey of clinicians and women, our data indicate that many would not regard the size of effect as worthwhile."
PMC3420230,S236,,It is a further strength of our study that we did an audit in parallel to determine whether participants were representative of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and to enable more detailed understanding of reasons for non-participation.
PMC3420230,S237,,"The results show that although a substantial proportion of women and clinicians had strong views on their treatment (both requesting and declining intervention), many women were willing to be randomised."
PMC3420230,S238,,The numbers recruited in this initial phase of the trial also limits the precision of our estimates of treatment effects on all other endpoints.
PMC3420230,S239,,The confidence intervals around the estimate of the effect of early term delivery on caesarean section are such that we cannot rule out a clinically meaningful increase.
PMC3420230,S240,,"In addition the chance imbalance in twin pregnancies between the two arms of the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison made interpretation of endpoints related to prematurity more difficult, as the relation between multiple pregnancy and premature delivery is strong."
PMC3420230,S241,,We would recommend stratification by singleton and multiple pregnancy in any future trial.

PMC3420230,S246,,"One further small trial of ursodeoxycholic acid versus glucose, vitamin C, and inosine in 68 women was reported from China, but the limited information given on trial conduct, methodology, and definitions makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions.28"
PMC3420230,S247,,An updated Cochrane systematic review on interventions for treating intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy has been submitted by our group.29
PMC3420230,S248,,"For maternal itch, assessed either through a categorical 0-4 scale or on a visual analogue 0-100 mm scale, three trials seemed to show a reduction24 25 28 and two showed no difference.26 27"

PMC3420230,S253,,"In our trial, the reduction from 20% to 8% in the ursodeoxycholic acid treated group was significant; a larger trial is needed to confirm or refute these important findings."
PMC3420230,S254,,"No other randomised controlled trials have studied timing of delivery in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, although two trials of early delivery in other conditions of moderately increased fetal risk have shown similar results."

PMC3420230,S259,,Meaning of the study
PMC3420230,S260,,The mechanism behind bile acid mediated adverse events and possible amelioration by ursodeoxycholic acid remains poorly understood.
PMC3420230,S261,,Post-mortem reports typically describe infants with normal growth and signs of acute anoxia without uteroplacental insufficiency.31
PMC3420230,S262,,Meconium stained amniotic fluid is often reported in fetal deaths related to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
PMC3420230,S263,,"Histological reports of placentas from affected women show non-specific morphological changes, including increased syncytial knot formation and villous oedema, consistent with hypoxia.32 33 34"
PMC3420230,S264,,These changes are also seen in a rodent model of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and are reversed after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.35
PMC3420230,S265,,"Similarly, human placental explants cultured with ursodeoxycholic acid do not develop syncytial knots in the presence of bile acids.36"
PMC3420230,S266,,It has been proposed that raised fetal bile acid levels in affected pregnancies result in fetal arrhythmia and subsequent anoxia or fetal death.37
PMC3420230,S267,,This hypothesis is supported by in vitro studies of rodent and human cardiomyocytes38 39 40 and by a study showing fetal atrial arrhythmia in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.41
PMC3420230,S268,,"Of relevance to this study, culture of cardiomyocytes with ursodeoxycholic acid prevented bile acid induced arrhythmias.40 42"
PMC3420230,S269,,The influence of ursodeoxycholic acid on fetal arrhythmia has not been studied in vivo in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
PMC3420230,S270,,Administering bile acid causes dose dependent increases in contractility of rat myometrium43 and when administered to pregnant sheep causes increased rates of preterm labour and meconium stained amniotic fluid.44
PMC3420230,S271,,No studies have been done on the influence of ursodeoxycholic acid on these models of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy related preterm labour.
PMC3420230,S272,,Increased rates of neonatal respiratory distress have been reported in the infants of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.45
PMC3420230,S273,,This may be related to bile acid mediated inhibition of phospholipase A2 and associated lack of surfactant.46
PMC3420230,S274,,"Although these studies have provided indirect evidence that raised maternal bile acid levels (and possibly associated increases in fetal bile acid levels) are implicated in the adverse fetal events of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and that some in vitro studies indicate that ursodeoxycholic acid may reverse bile acid induced adverse fetal events, conclusive evidence of fetal benefit and lack of harm remains elusive."
PMC3420230,S275,,Unanswered questions and future research
PMC3420230,S276,,Definitive evidence for fetal benefit with both interventions is still lacking.
PMC3420230,S277,,"Women and clinicians are willing to participate in both trials, and participants have the same spectrum of disease severity as non-participants, so trial event rates estimated from population studies will apply."
PMC3420230,S278,,We estimate that involvement of about half of the maternity units in the United Kingdom would recruit 636 participants per year to a trial of the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison and 340 per year to a trial of the timing of delivery comparison.
PMC3420230,S279,,"Using a reasonable population estimate of 11% for a primary composite endpoint of perinatal death or morbidity for women randomised to the ursodeoxycholic acid comparison, a trial with reasonable power to detect a plausible effect size can be designed."
PMC3420230,S280,,"It may have to be run internationally, but we believe it is a priority."
PMC3420230,S281,,"The rate of a similar composite fetal endpoint for the timed delivery comparison would be lower, since by definition participants have already reached 37 weeks."
PMC3420230,S282,,"Given this, and the lower recruitment rate, a trial to test the hypothesis that early term delivery reduces fetal morbidity would need to be both larger and more expensive."
PMC3420230,S283,,"Since timed delivery is such a generic intervention, and there is some evidence from other trials that induction does not increase the incidence of caesarean section, obstetricians and funders may decide that a trial to test this intervention properly is not a priority."
PMC3420230,S284,,"Some obstetricians and women will reasonably decide to implement early term delivery, at least in women with the highest bile acid levels, without a trial."
PMC3420230,S285,,Conclusions
PMC3420230,S286,,Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly reduces maternal pruritus in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
PMC3420230,S287,,"However, the size of effect is small, so some women and clinicians may question whether the degree of benefit is clinically meaningful, particularly for a drug that is unlicensed in pregnancy."
PMC3420230,S288,,"Others, perhaps those with the most severe itch, may want to take the drug, since this study has proved that it does have some effect."
PMC3420230,S289,,"The significant reduction in meconium stained amniotic fluid seen in our study, similar to the results of one other trial, raises the prospect that ursodeoxycholic acid may confer fetal benefits and therefore is reassuring for fetal safety."
PMC3420230,S290,,"However, the overall risks and benefits of ursodeoxycholic acid to the fetus require evaluation in a larger trial, which we believe is feasible."
PMC3420230,S291,,"In women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, early term delivery at 37-38 weeksâ€™ gestation did not increase the incidence of caesarean section."
PMC3420230,S292,,A larger trial to evaluate this question further may not be realistic.
PMC3420230,S293,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3420230,S294,,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is associated with increased rates of spontaneous preterm labour and fetal asphyxial events
PMC3420230,S295,,Ursodeoxycholic acid and early term delivery are widely used for affected women but the benefits and risks are uncertain
PMC3420230,S296,,What this study adds
PMC3420230,S297,,"Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces pruritus significantly in pregnant women, but the size of the benefit is small"
PMC3420230,S298,,Early term delivery does not seem to be associated with increased incidence of caesarean section

PMC3489506,S3,,Abstract
PMC3489506,S4,,Objective To assess the effectiveness and safety of melatonin in treating severe sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
PMC3489506,S5,,Design 12 week double masked randomised placebo controlled phase III trial.
PMC3489506,S6,,Setting 19 hospitals across England and Wales.
PMC3489506,S7,,Participants 146 children aged 3 years to 15 years 8 months were randomised.
PMC3489506,S8,,They had a range of neurological and developmental disorders and a severe sleep problem that had not responded to a standardised sleep behaviour advice booklet provided to parents four to six weeks before randomisation.
PMC3489506,S9,,A sleep problem was defined as the child not falling asleep within one hour of lights out or having less than six hoursâ€™ continuous sleep.
PMC3489506,S10,,Interventions Immediate release melatonin or matching placebo capsules administered 45 minutes before the childâ€™s bedtime for a period of 12 weeks.
PMC3489506,S11,,"All children started with a 0.5 mg capsule, which was increased through 2 mg, 6 mg, and 12 mg depending on their response to treatment."
PMC3489506,S12,,Main outcome measures Total sleep time at night after 12 weeks adjusted for baseline recorded in sleep diaries completed by the parent.
PMC3489506,S13,,"Secondary outcomes included sleep onset latency, assessments of child behaviour, family functioning, and adverse events."
PMC3489506,S14,,Sleep was measured with diaries and actigraphy.
PMC3489506,S15,,Results Melatonin increased total sleep time by 22.4 minutes (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 44.3 minutes) measured by sleep diaries (n=110) and 13.3 (âˆ’15.5 to 42.2) measured by actigraphy (n=59).
PMC3489506,S16,,"Melatonin reduced sleep onset latency measured by sleep diaries (âˆ’37.5 minutes, âˆ’55.3 to âˆ’19.7 minutes) and actigraphy (âˆ’45.3 minutes, âˆ’68.8 to âˆ’21.9 minutes) and was most effective for children with the longest sleep latency (P=0.009)."
PMC3489506,S17,,"Melatonin was associated with earlier waking times than placebo (29.9 minutes, 13.6 to 46.3 minutes)."
PMC3489506,S18,,Child behaviour and family functioning outcomes showed some improvement and favoured use of melatonin.
PMC3489506,S19,,Adverse events were mild and similar between the two groups.
PMC3489506,S20,,"Conclusions Children gained little additional sleep on melatonin; though they fell asleep significantly faster, waking times became earlier."
PMC3489506,S21,,Child behaviour and family functioning outcomes did not significantly improve.
PMC3489506,S22,,Melatonin was tolerable over this three month period.
PMC3489506,S23,,Comparisons with slow release melatonin preparations or melatonin analogues are required.

PMC3489506,S25,,Introduction
PMC3489506,S26,,Children with neurological and developmental disorders have a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than their unaffected peers.1
PMC3489506,S27,,"Sleeping difficulties are often chronic and can result in additional learning and behaviour problems,2 affect the whole familyâ€™s health and wellbeing, and impair ability to continue in employment or further education.3"
PMC3489506,S28,,"Despite limited evidence of the effectiveness of exogenous melatonin and some concerns regarding safety, it is commonly prescribed to children with neurodevelopmental delay, with wide variations in dose,4 because of its sleep phase shifting and hypnotic properties5 6."
PMC3489506,S29,,"Systematic reviews have looked at the effect of melatonin on sleep parameters4 7 8 9 10 with recommendations that additional randomised trials of melatonin be undertaken in children with sleep disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders, autism, or intellectual disability.4 7 8"
PMC3489506,S30,,We were commissioned to carry out this study after successfully replying to a call from the Health Technology Assessment Programme (part of the UK National Institute of Health Research) to assess the use of melatonin in children with impaired sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders.

PMC3489506,S106,,The proportion of randomised participants who completed follow-up was high at 94% (66/70) for melatonin and 92% (70/76) for placebo.
PMC3489506,S107,,"Proportions included within the primary outcome analysis were 73% (51/70) for melatonin and 78% (59/76) for placebo, largely because of the longitudinal data required (minimum of five nightsâ€™ complete sleep diary)."
PMC3489506,S108,,We conducted a range of sensitivity analyses with regards to the missing data.
PMC3489506,S109,,"These sensitivity analyses, which included reducing the number of nightsâ€™ sleep required to contribute to the analysis and imputing worse/best recorded sleep parameters to complete the sleep diaries, showed the robustness of conclusions."
PMC3489506,S110,,Dose escalation
PMC3489506,S111,,Table 2 shows that participants randomised to placebo titrated more rapidly up to the maximum dose capsules.
PMC3489506,S112,,Twelve weeks after randomisation only 19 (38%) participants receiving active melatonin had escalated to the maximum dose (12 mg) compared with 49 (83%) receiving placebo.
PMC3489506,S113,,Nine children (18%) in the active group remained taking the lowest dose (0.5 mg) compared with one child (2%) in the placebo group.

PMC3489506,S135,,"After randomisation, 67% (47/70) and 79% (60/76) of participants on melatonin and placebo, respectively, provided saliva samples for the calculation of dim light melatonin onset, of which 15 and 12, respectively, were of insufficient volume for analysis and the time of onset could not be ascertained for 25 (melatonin) and seven (placebo) participants."
PMC3489506,S136,,This difference between the two groups was not detected before randomisation.
PMC3489506,S137,,"Where onset could not be calculated the reasons were possible contamination (23 melatonin and three placebo); high baseline concentrations (two melatonin), and low volume (four placebo)."
PMC3489506,S138,,The limited data prevent meaningful analysis of the impact of this phenomenon on treatment response.
PMC3489506,S139,,Tolerability outcomes
PMC3489506,S140,,Table 6 shows the number of participants experiencing any treatment emergent sign or symptom (TESS).
PMC3489506,S141,,"No formal statistical tests were undertaken, and the results for each group seemed similar."

PMC3489506,S150,,Inclusion of age or weight in the models did not improve the fit.
PMC3489506,S151,,"The magnitude of sleep onset latency as determined by baseline sleep diaries, however, modified the treatment effect for sleep onset latency such that melatonin had a greater effect in those with a greater problem of getting to sleep (P=0.009); this was not evident for total sleep time (P=0.19)."

PMC3489506,S158,,Discussion
PMC3489506,S159,,"In children with neurodevelopmental disorders and sleep problems, immediate release melatonin was found to be more effective than placebo in increasing total sleep time and reducing sleep onset latency."
PMC3489506,S160,,"In this randomised double masked placebo controlled trial, adverse effects were few, mild in degree, and distributed equally between the two groups with no increase in, or new onset of, epileptic seizures."
PMC3489506,S161,,Total sleep time increased by an average of 23 minutes and sleep onset latency reduced by an average of 38 minutes.
PMC3489506,S162,,Relation to other studies
PMC3489506,S163,,Several systematic reviews have aimed to determine the effect of melatonin on sleep parameters (table 9).
PMC3489506,S164,,"The inclusion criteria of the systematic reviews vary as do the conclusions regarding the effect of melatonin, from definitive absence of effect10 to evidence of effect,8 and emphasising the need for large confirmatory randomised controlled trials.4 7"
PMC3489506,S165,,Table 9 â€‚Summary of findings from systematic reviews of melatonin v placebo to treat sleep disorders
PMC3489506,S166,,"The trials included within each meta-analysis were heterogeneous in terms of populations of patients and the dose, time, and durations of study treatments."
PMC3489506,S167,,"Of methodological concern are the number of small trials, suspicions of outcome reporting bias25 within the trials,26 and the use of a crossover design, the suitability of which has been questioned because of the impact on the circadian timing system outlasting drug washout periods.8 27"
PMC3489506,S168,,"The impact of varying methods used to measure sleep, while not considered to be of importance in Buscemi and colleagues,10 has been discussed by Rossignol and Frye7 and Philips and Appleton.4"
PMC3489506,S169,,"The differences in the methods used are evident in the results of our study, particularly for total sleep time."
PMC3489506,S170,,"The difference could in part be attributed to night wakenings missed by parents, though, as described by Philips and Appleton,4 the relevance and clinical importance of changes in sleep pattern that are not noted by parents and do not disrupt their own sleep is debatable."
PMC3489506,S171,,"The effect estimate of melatonin on total sleep time in our study is largely consistent with that reported by Buscemi and colleagues,10 while the estimates reported by Rossignol and Frye7 and Braam and colleagues8 in patients with intellectual disability and autistic spectrum disorders extend to the upper limit of our confidence interval."
PMC3489506,S172,,"This is in contrast with a recent open label dose escalation study of 24 children with autism, which reported no improvement on total sleep time.28"
PMC3489506,S173,,"Our exploratory analysis did not identify autism as a modifier of treatment effect, suggesting the differences in the size of effect are not explained by differences in populations of patients."
PMC3489506,S174,,The effect of melatonin on sleep onset latency was both clinically and statistically significant based on both sleep diaries and actigraphic measures.
PMC3489506,S175,,The minimum clinically relevant difference defined a priori was 30 minutes and was held within the confidence intervals for both sleep diaries and actigraphy.
PMC3489506,S176,,"This reduction is consistent with other reports of the use of melatonin in typically developing children (35 minutes),29 children with intellectual disabilities (34 minutes),8 and children with autism (39 minutes).7"
PMC3489506,S177,,In keeping with a recent study on typically developing children we found that melatonin was most effective for those children with the longest sleep latency.29
PMC3489506,S178,,The finding that our children receiving melatonin woke earlier than controls by the end of the three month study is interesting and has not been previously reported in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
PMC3489506,S179,,"It is consistent with the effect of melatonin in laboratory controlled studies30 and suggests that evening exogenous melatonin advances sleep phase over time and therefore children fall asleep earlier but also wake earlier, explaining the smaller effect on total sleep time."
PMC3489506,S180,,Results for dim light melatonin onset were disappointing.
PMC3489506,S181,,"If samples are taken regularly for a 24 hour period the onset should be measurable, whenever it occurs."
PMC3489506,S182,,"For practical reasons, however, it is common in paediatric populations to take five swabs before bedtime."
PMC3489506,S183,,It is therefore possible to â€œmissâ€ù an onset that precedes sampling or occurs when sampling has finished.
PMC3489506,S184,,"Some of the contamination and high baseline values in the melatonin arm could reflect children who are poor metabolisers and whose concentrations of exogenous melatonin had accumulated during the study; however, it might also reflect that the dose of melatonin was not actually omitted on the two nights as required in the protocol."
PMC3489506,S185,,"Only low doses of melatonin are required to alter the sleep phase in typically developing children, and, in this study, there was support for starting treatment with a low dose of melatonin with 18% of children needing only 0.5 mg melatonin."
PMC3489506,S186,,"Although high doses might usefully promote the sedative action of melatonin in some children with neurodevelopmental disorders, this might not be the case for slow metabolisers of melatonin.31"
PMC3489506,S187,,Measures of child behaviour and family quality of life tended to favour melatonin but were not significant.
PMC3489506,S188,,"There are several possible explanations for this, including the possibility that our measures were not sensitive enough over this time period."
PMC3489506,S189,,We speculate that this might also be because of the relatively minor effect melatonin had on total sleep time across this study.
PMC3489506,S190,,Strengths and limitations
PMC3489506,S191,,This was the first randomised controlled trial specifically designed and powered to assess the impact of melatonin on total sleep time over a three month period.
PMC3489506,S192,,We used subjective and objective assessments of sleep and had a standardised parental sleep behavioural intervention before treatment with melatonin during which a routine bedtime was established.
PMC3489506,S193,,We also had a systematic dose escalation protocol and included secondary outcomes such as behavioural function and quality of life measures.
PMC3489506,S194,,"The study had a relatively long duration (one month behavioural intervention and then three month drug trial) and wide inclusion criteria across all children with neurodevelopmental delay, maximising generalisability of results to everyday clinical practice."
PMC3489506,S195,,A limitation is the relatively high number of participants who were either unable to tolerate actigraphy or in whom actigraphy equipment failed.
PMC3489506,S196,,"Unfortunately, the combination in many children of both autistic spectrum disorders (in particular sensory sensitivities) and severe learning difficulties meant that actigraphy was often not well tolerated, and more watches were broken or lost than expected."
PMC3489506,S197,,"We have considerable previous clinical and research experience using actigraphy, but few studies have attempted to use actigraphy for this period of time in this particular population."
PMC3489506,S198,,"In a shorter open label study of children with autism and normal intelligence, 25% of actiwatches still needed to be used in alternative places.28"
PMC3489506,S199,,"Although we decided not to use non-standard actigraphy placements such as shoulder/waist for this study, this should be an important consideration for future similar trials."
PMC3489506,S200,,"Carersâ€™ diaries, even for this prolonged period, were well received in this study in contrast with other reports.7 32"
PMC3489506,S201,,Our 95% confidence intervals for total sleep time did not contain the minimum clinically important difference of 60 minutes that we defined before the study.

PMC3502035,S2,,Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: multicentre randomised controlled trial
PMC3502035,S3,,Abstract
PMC3502035,S4,,Objective To determine the effectiveness of intensive structured care to optimise blood pressure control based on individual absolute risk targets in primary care.
PMC3502035,S5,,Design Pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial.
PMC3502035,S6,,"Setting General practices throughout Australia, except Northern Territory, 2009-11."
PMC3502035,S7,,Participants Of 2185 patients from 119 general practices who were eligible for drug treatment for hypertension according to national guidelines 416 (19.0%) achieved their individual blood pressure target during a 28 day run-in period of monotherapy.
PMC3502035,S8,,"After exclusions, 1562 participants not at target blood pressure (systolic 150 (SD 17) mm Hg, diastolic 88 (SD 11) mm Hg) were randomised (1:2 ratio) to usual care (n=524) or the intervention (n=1038)."
PMC3502035,S9,,Intervention Computer assisted clinical profiling and risk target setting (all participants) with intensified follow-up and stepwise drug titration (initial angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy or two forms of combination therapy using angiotensin receptor blockers) for those randomised to the intervention.
PMC3502035,S10,,The control group received usual care.
PMC3502035,S11,,Main outcome measures The primary outcome was individual blood pressure target achieved at 26 weeks.
PMC3502035,S12,,"Secondary outcomes were change in mean sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, absolute risk for cardiovascular disease within five years based on the Framingham risk score, and proportion and rate of adverse events."
PMC3502035,S13,,"Results On an intention to treat basis, there was an 8.8% absolute difference in individual blood pressure target achieved at 26 weeks in favour of the intervention group compared with usual care group (358/988 (36.2%) v 138/504 (27.4%)): adjusted relative risk 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.49, P=0.0013)."
PMC3502035,S14,,"There was also a 9.5% absolute difference in favour of the intervention group for achieving the classic blood pressure target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg (627/988 (63.5%) v 272/504 (54.0%)): adjusted relative risk 1.18 (1.07 to 1.29, P<0.001)."
PMC3502035,S15,,The intervention group achieved a mean adjusted reduction in systolic blood pressure of 13.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval âˆ’12.3 to âˆ’14.2 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure of 7.7 mm Hg (âˆ’7.1 to âˆ’8.3 mm Hg) v 10.1 mm Hg (âˆ’8.8 to 11.3 mm Hg) and 5.5 mm Hg (âˆ’4.7 to âˆ’6.2 mm Hg) in the usual care group (P<0.001).
PMC3502035,S16,,"Among 1141 participants in whom five year absolute cardiovascular risk scores were calculated from baseline to the 26 week follow-up, the reduction in risk scores was greater in the intervention group than usual care group (14.7% (SD 9.3%) to 10.9% (SD 8.0%); difference âˆ’3.7% (SD 4.5%) and 15.0% (SD 10.1%) to 12.4% (SD 9.4%); âˆ’2.6% (SD 4.5%): adjusted mean difference âˆ’1.13% (95% confidence interval âˆ’0.69% to âˆ’1.63%; P<0.001)."
PMC3502035,S17,,Owing to adverse events 82 (7.9%) participants in the intervention group and 10 (1.9%) in the usual care group had their drug treatment modified.
PMC3502035,S18,,"Conclusions In a primary care setting intensive structured care resulted in higher levels of blood pressure control, with clinically lower blood pressure and absolute risk of future cardiovascular events overall and with more people achieving their target blood pressure."
PMC3502035,S19,,An important gap in treatment remains though and applying intensive management and achieving currently advocated risk based blood pressure targets is challenging.
PMC3502035,S20,,Introduction
PMC3502035,S21,,"Although hypertension is a readily detectable and modifiable condition it is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cardiovascular risk factor, including tobacco use, obesity, and lipid disorders.1"
PMC3502035,S22,,"In the United States, of all modifiable risk factors hypertension has been associated with the greatest population attributable risk for all cause mortality (30%) and deaths from cardiovascular disease (40%).2"
PMC3502035,S23,,Epidemiological studies suggest a relation between raised blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular events.3
PMC3502035,S24,,Large scale clinical trials examining the efficacy of a broad range of antihypertensives found a consistent and continuous reduction in cardiovascular risk (primary or secondary events and across all age groups) according to the baseline values and magnitude of change in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.3
PMC3502035,S25,,"Traditionally, the ideal blood pressure target has been â‰_140/90 mm Hg for those aged less than 80 years and these are reflected in current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom.4"
PMC3502035,S26,,"The introduction of absolute risk profiling for primary prevention purposes4 5 and more stringent, individualised blood pressure targets for higher risk groups such as people with type 2 diabetes or more advanced forms of cardiovascular disease6 7 has provided clinicians in other regions of the world with a challenge in meeting these targets."
PMC3502035,S27,,Considering the recent debate on whether more stringent blood pressure targets fail to provide cardioprotection and perhaps even confer harm at blood pressure levels approaching 110/75 mm Hg8 it is likely that more stringent blood pressure targets will be subject to further consideration.
PMC3502035,S28,,"Regardless of recommended blood pressure targets, however, the translation of potential benefits from clinical trials to the real life management of hypertension (much of which occurs in primary care) is less than ideal."
PMC3502035,S29,,Many people prescribed antihypertensive treatment have a blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg.9
PMC3502035,S30,,A key component of effective translation in the primary care setting seems to be the application of structured programmes to apply antihypertensive treatments by a rigorous stepped care approach10 to overcome the common phenomenon of prescription resistance11 (whereby clinicians are reluctant to up-titrate existing drug treatment or prescribe additional antihypertensive agents) and to achieve better individual blood pressure control.
PMC3502035,S31,,"For example, nurse led interventions that comprise a structured care algorithm are associated with greater reductions in blood pressure levels than usual care overall.12"
PMC3502035,S32,,"Few studies, however, have specifically tested the application of structured care in the setting of more stringent, risk based blood pressure targets in a large and diverse range of general practicesâ€”that is, small to large clinics and those with and without practice nurses to implement structured care."
PMC3502035,S33,,"As described elsewhere,13 the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure (VIPER-BP) study was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised trial evaluating the clinical effectiveness and overall safety of a more intensive and structured approach to optimising blood pressure control in a group of people with persistently high blood pressure in a real world primary care setting."
PMC3502035,S34,,"In a typical cohort of primary care patients with suboptimal blood pressure (individualised target according to their risk profile6), we hypothesised that a greater proportion of those randomised to the intervention would achieve individualised blood pressure control at the end of 26 weeks compared with those randomised to usual care."

PMC3502035,S102,,"Of those who entered the run-in phase, 1329 (60.8%) had pre-existing hypertension and had been treated for a median of 5 (interquartile range 2-10) years."
PMC3502035,S103,,"Previous treatment, which was stopped on entry to the study, comprised monotherapy with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (n=907, 68.2%), a calcium channel antagonist (n=233, 17.5%), or combination antihypertensive treatment (n=259, 19.5%)."
PMC3502035,S104,,"The initial blood pressure target for these 2185 participants was â‰_125/75 mm Hg in 330 (15.1%), â‰_130/80 mm Hg in 993 (45.4%), and â‰_140/90 mm Hg in 862 (39.5%)."

PMC3502035,S108,,"The proportion of patients treated for hypertension before the study run-in phase (40% with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 20% with an angiotensin receptor blocker, and 21% with combination therapy including a calcium antagonist or diuretic) had increased to 66.9%, with little difference between the groups."
PMC3502035,S109,,The groups were well matched for clinical and personal characteristics and prespecified blood pressure targets.
PMC3502035,S110,,"At randomisation, 219 (14.0% with equal proportions in each group) were assigned to a blood pressure target that differed from the recommended (automated) clinical profile; these reflected general practitionersâ€™ discretion for a mostly higher blood pressure target than recommended."

PMC3502035,S119,,"At randomisation, most participants in the intervention arm were prescribed their per protocol treatment: 334/360 (92.8%) monotherapy (valsartan 160 mg daily), 228/250 (91.2%) hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy (valsartan 80 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily), and 398/417 (95.4%) amlodipine combination (valsartan 80 mg + amlodipine 5 mg daily); 11 participants in the combination arm (all early study withdrawals) did not have their combination treatment selected at randomisation."
PMC3502035,S120,,"In the next six weeks, 108 (32%), 118 (52%), and 207 (52%) of these participants, respectively, had progressed to the next level treatment as per study protocol."

PMC3502035,S123,,"Alternatively, prescription resistance with deviation from the management protocol was evident in 360 participants (34.7%): most deviations (>90%) involved general practitioners not up-titrating antihypertensive treatment to achieve one of the two lower blood pressure targets."

PMC3502035,S132,,"Clinically important falls in mean and systolic blood pressure were observed in both groups during the 26 weeks of follow-up, with a lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure value recorded after randomisation in 311 (59.4%) participants in the usual care group compared with 719 (69.3%) in the intervention group."
PMC3502035,S133,,Individualised control of blood pressure showed an inverse gradient; lower rates of achieving the blood pressure target were associated with more stringent targets (P<0.001) but better rates of control throughout in the intervention group.

PMC3502035,S153,,"In the usual care and intervention groups, respectively, this included six and eight events involving admission to hospital for chest pain/angina pectoris, one (in each group) for acute myocardial infarction, and four (in each group) for other cardiovascular events."

PMC3502035,S156,,Discussion
PMC3502035,S157,,"A strategy comprising automated risk profiling plus standardised guideline based, stepwise drug treatment (initial monotherapy using an angiotensin receptor blocker or two forms of combination therapy) and intensified follow-up and treatment titration, resulted in more participants (absolute difference 8.8%) with persistent hypertension achieving their individual blood pressure target at 26 weeks than participants receiving usual care."
PMC3502035,S158,,"Importantly, two thirds of the participants had a history of persistent hypertension despite receiving a typical range of antihypertensive treatments, and the remainder were unresponsive to valsartan monotherapy; one of the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive agents globally."
PMC3502035,S159,,The study population had an average five year risk of a major cardiovascular event of over 15% and therefore represented the more difficult end of the spectrum of people with hypertension managed in primary care.
PMC3502035,S160,,"The detailed clinical profiling at study entry and general practitionersâ€™ access to the computer assisted treatment protocol may explain the large, clinically significant, reductions in blood pressure in both groups (mean change >13/7 mm Hg in the intervention group and >10/5 mm Hg in the control group)."
PMC3502035,S161,,The combined application of more intensive follow-up and drug treatment is reflected in greater use of combination therapies (prescribed as single pills) and progressive reductions in blood pressure between six and 26 weeks in the intervention group.
PMC3502035,S162,,"These incremental benefits in blood pressure control largely influenced more favourable absolute cardiovascular risk scores in participants assigned to intervention, with just over one third in this group achieving their individual blood pressure target and around two thirds the classic blood pressure target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg; the same advocated by NICE in the United Kingdom.4"
PMC3502035,S163,,"If further adjustment is made for those who initially responded to more intensive management and monotherapy using an angiotensin receptor blocker at study run-in (apportioning equal success and failure to both treatment groups), this figure increases from 64% to 72%."
PMC3502035,S164,,An important trade-off for what could be considered to be modest absolute differences in absolute blood pressure levels between groups was the small increase in the proportion of participants who withdrew from the study (1.1% v 0.2%) and more frequent (7.9% v 1.9%) modification of treatment due to adverse events in the intervention group.
PMC3502035,S165,,Strengths and limitations of this study
PMC3502035,S166,,The intervention directly addressed the difficult challenge of optimising blood pressure control in a real world general practice setting using commonly prescribed forms of antihypertensive agents.
PMC3502035,S167,,"This is a major concern for countries with aging populations, where hypertension related heart and cerebrovascular disease is a growing problem.14"
PMC3502035,S168,,"By necessity, this pragmatic study used an open label design (with no blinding of treatment pathways or blood pressure measurements possible) with scheduled visits that varied according to clinic schedules and prescribed drug treatment and relied on the mainstream healthcare system in Australia."
PMC3502035,S169,,The broader application and possible impact of the intervention (particularly in other healthcare systems) therefore needs to be interpreted cautiously.
PMC3502035,S170,,"However, we do have preliminary projections (data not shown) based on national primary care data in Australia, that even the modest absolute differences in blood pressure between groups would have a potentially large impact (as reflected in the primary endpoint and absolute risk differences) among the thousands of Australians who donâ€™t achieve their blood pressure targets each year."
PMC3502035,S171,,"The selection of valsartan based treatments, rather than an open choice of agents, was predicated on the ability to standardise drug treatment in the intervention arm with precise up-titration pathways and to determine the potential impact of monotherapy versus combination therapy on short (six weeks) and longer term (26 weeks) blood pressure control."
PMC3502035,S172,,"Certainly these agents targeting the renin-angiotensin system represent some of the most commonly applied in clinical practice internationally, and the treatment regimen is broadly consistent with the NICE guidelines (phase 3) for people with hypertension who do not respond to initial monotherapy.4"
PMC3502035,S173,,We deliberately chose individual randomisation rather than a cluster design to increase the robustness of our findings for two reasons.
PMC3502035,S174,,"Firstly, we wanted to avoid potential imbalances between the groups when using a larger unit of randomisation (that is, a general practice)."
PMC3502035,S175,,"Secondly, we wanted to expose participants with the same general practitioner to the two study groups (and indeed treatment arms within the intervention group) to truly determine if the programme would alter blood pressure management at the individual level."
PMC3502035,S176,,"Although this resulted in almost inevitable cross contamination of more intensive management in the usual care group (with clinically significant reductions in blood pressure in both groups), we were still able to show that the intervention was associated with incremental benefits in blood pressure control (8.8% absolute difference in the primary endpoint) tempered by more adverse events requiring adjustment of treatment."
PMC3502035,S177,,"Alternatively, unblinded blood pressures in the clinic reported by general practitioners (albeit using a standardised protocol and automated monitors) may have resulted in an element of bias, the recruitment of participants with so called white coat hypertension,15 or an observed regression to the mean (blood pressure) over time."
PMC3502035,S178,,"Wherever possible we minimised these factors by implementing a 28 day standardised treatment and blood pressure monitoring run-in phase, applying a standardised protocol for blood pressure monitoring and undertaking independent clinical auditing for data verification."
PMC3502035,S179,,Whether these data would be reproduced if we had studied 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure or home blood pressure measurements is open to debate.16
PMC3502035,S180,,"However, at this time current guidelines are based on clinic blood pressure measurements and the study reflects current clinical practice in most countries."
PMC3502035,S181,,We do not know as of yet if the reduction in absolute cardiovascular risk will be maintained or result in fewer cardiovascular events in the future.
PMC3502035,S182,,"Notably, 4% of randomised participants did not have an endpoint blood pressure recorded and were excluded from endpoint analyses."
PMC3502035,S183,,"For these 70 participants, retrospective analyses where either the randomised blood pressure was brought forward (relative risk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.48) or the change in blood pressure was imputed according to study group and blood pressure target (1.26, 1.08 to 1.46) did not substantially alter the primary endpoint results (P<0.001 for both comparisons)."
PMC3502035,S184,,"The general practitioners were reluctant to try to meet the more aggressive guideline targets for blood pressure reduction and in almost 15% of cases opted for a more lenient target, in effect making the task of achieving control easier."
PMC3502035,S185,,Supporting the evidence in favour of structured primary care
PMC3502035,S186,,"Consistent with data from other countries such as the United States,2 we have strong evidence from community based studies,9 preliminary data from the pilot stages of the VIPER-BP study,13 and data from the usual care group, that present approaches to the management of hypertension have meant that the â€œrule of halvesâ€ù still appliesâ€”that is, close to 50% of those treated for hypertension in primary care remain hypertensive."
PMC3502035,S187,,"Regardless of recent suggestions that lower blood pressure targets in high risk people should be reassessed,8 there is still clear evidence from population cohorts2 and meta-analyses of clinical trial data3 that lowering blood pressure (even by the modest, incremental margins associated with more intensive management) will noticeably attenuate the rates of stroke and other cardiovascular disease."
PMC3502035,S188,,"In support of a more aggressive approach to the management of hypertension, retrospective results from both the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation trial17 18 and Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Hypertension19 trial suggest there are advantages to achieving early blood pressure control and that application of combination treatments are more likely to achieve this goal."
PMC3502035,S189,,"The intervention in the current study brought all these elements together, with more than double (81% v 40%) the proportion of intervention participants receiving combination therapy compared with monotherapy at 26 weeks."
PMC3502035,S190,,To our knowledge this study (incorporating a combined drug and disease management approach to the management of blood pressure facilitated by a standardised computer support program) is one of the largest studies of its kind.
PMC3502035,S191,,"Although there have been several large hypertension trials with a major focus on the efficacy of different combinations of drug treatment20 and specific studies of algorithm based strategies,10 12 there are few large scale, multicentre studies that have specifically compared a structured and intensive care approach with usual care in achieving better blood pressure control based on more stringent risk based targets in patients with persistent hypertension managed in primary care."
PMC3502035,S192,,The results of the present study therefore strengthen the conclusions of a recently updated Cochrane review recommending a stepped and intensive approach to the management of hypertension in primary care; particularly in those participants who remain hypertensive despite initial treatment.10
PMC3502035,S193,,"In particular, the results complement the findings of a similarly large scale (cluster randomised design) Canadian study21 of a simplified treatment algorithm in primary care that showed a 12% absolute difference (65% v 53%) in favour of the study intervention."
PMC3502035,S194,,Notable differences were the low proportion of participants requiring more stringent blood pressure targets (about 15%) and the lack of initial standardised care that in the present study resulted in almost one in five participants achieving early blood pressure control during the study run-in phase.
PMC3502035,S195,,Thus our randomised cohort represented a more â€œchallengingâ€ù group of patients with hypertension.
PMC3502035,S196,,"It could be argued that we have now reached a similar stage of developing the evidence in favour of more structured care (that is, beyond a purely drug related approach) to optimise blood pressure management in primary care to that of heart failure management programmes; where head to head trials of different forms of structured care are being undertaken22 to refine (rather than to establish) a new level of best clinical practice."
PMC3502035,S197,,Clinical implications
PMC3502035,S198,,Several important issues highlighted by this pragmatic study involving more than 250 general practitioners are relevant to clinical practice guidelines and health policy in Australia and other high income countries where hypertension remains a problem.
PMC3502035,S199,,"Firstly, the initial application of standardised monotherapy (valsartan 80 mg/day) in a structured approach, irrespective of previous treatment, was immediately successful in controlling a large group of people with hypertension and should be considered when reviewing primary endpoint data."
PMC3502035,S200,,"Given its size and direct relevance to other high income countries, the study is likely to influence future blood pressure guidelines, particularly informing debate around the attainment of lower blood pressure targets, whether these lower targets are truly achievable, and the role of prescription resistance11 in limiting what is meant by â€œtruly achievable.â€ù"
PMC3502035,S201,,Only a small proportion of participants in the most stringent blood pressure group achieved this target despite the intensive approach with three or more drugs applied in the intervention.
PMC3502035,S202,,"Given the nature of the study, these data are likely to reflect real world blood pressure management, and any consideration of retaining more stringent blood pressure targets (particularly if low values are proved to be unnecessary in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease8) has to consider the impact of at least aiming for lower blood pressure to achieve values â‰_140/90 mm Hg."
PMC3502035,S203,,Both an overall reluctance by general practitioners to prescribe higher doses of combination or triple treatment and individual patient factors seem to have prevented more participants from reaching their individual blood pressure target and the classic target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg.
PMC3502035,S204,,"It is worth highlighting that in the Australian healthcare system, subsidised drug treatment ensures that costs are not usually a barrier to the application of more aggressive treatment."
PMC3502035,S205,,"Although the absolute difference in change in blood pressure between the groups might be considered modest, they not only contributed to more people achieving the primary endpoint in the intervention group but also favourably altered both the absolute risk of future cardiovascular events (a clinically meaningful 1% difference in mean scores between groups) and the relative risk reduction of future coronary artery disease (âˆ’6% difference in mean risk) and strokes (âˆ’11% difference) in favour of the intervention (data not shown)."
PMC3502035,S206,,"The expected trade-off between more intense blood pressure control and an increase in adverse events occurred, with more participants in the intervention group withdrawn on this basis (1.1% v 0.2%) or requiring active change to their treatment (7.9% v 1.9%)."
PMC3502035,S207,,This needs to be carefully considered against the overall difference (8.8% in favour of the intervention group) in the primary endpoint.
PMC3502035,S208,,"Overall, the number and frequency of adverse events was consistent with the nature and size of the patient cohort and the drugs being prescribed."
PMC3502035,S209,,"Whereas there seems to be a gradient in blood pressure control according to the amount of drug treatment (with greater control achieved in those assigned to immediate combination therapy at randomisation), spending additional clinical time (>1 hour over six months) with participants probably also contributed."
PMC3502035,S210,,"Such a conclusion is consistent with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses,10 and the patient centred approach advocated by contemporary guidelines.4 6 7"
PMC3502035,S211,,This observation is further strengthened by the initial response to the run-in phase of the study where information on non-drug measures was provided with only low dose monotherapy (19% blood pressure control) and substantial anecdotal evidence from participants who appreciated the â€œbeyond pharmacologicalâ€ù approach to their management.
PMC3502035,S212,,Future challenges
PMC3502035,S213,,"Despite noticeable reductions in blood pressure in both arms of the VIPER-BP study, a relatively small proportion of participants achieved these more stringent blood pressure targets; the classic target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg being far more attainable."
PMC3502035,S214,,"Given the intensity of the intervention and facilitated pathways to higher doses of combination antihypertensive treatment, these data highlight critical questions around the application of more stringent blood pressure targets in high risk peopleâ€”that is, those with established cardiovascular disease or renal disease."
PMC3502035,S215,,The results are particularly relevant to clinicians when clinical guidelines and health policies seek to apply expert recommendations that may not be truly achievable.
PMC3502035,S216,,"As such, these data may prompt a re-evaluation of blood pressure targets to reflect real world limitations for doctors managing hypertension in the busy and often complex primary care setting."
PMC3502035,S217,,The results also point to major patient related barriers to eviscerating blood pressure targets as even with best practice drug prescription and clinical support most participants still did not achieve the primary endpoint of blood pressure recommended by current guidelines.
PMC3502035,S218,,"Most importantly, however, we have shown that a structured blood pressure management approach (computer assisted) results in higher blood pressure control rates in a primary care setting."
PMC3502035,S219,,"As always, the challenge will be to implement this strategy into wider clinical practice by further analysing what did and did not work in this and other similar studies and how best to deliver pragmatic tools to facilitate the optimal management of blood pressure in the primary care setting."
PMC3502035,S220,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3502035,S221,,Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide and one of the most common conditions managed in primary care
PMC3502035,S222,,"Despite effective drug treatments, a substantial proportion of affected people remain above their ideal blood pressure target"
PMC3502035,S223,,Systematic reviews suggest that additional gains in blood pressure control can be attained with a more intensive structured approach to management
PMC3502035,S224,,What this study adds
PMC3502035,S225,,"Compared with usual care, an intensive, structured programme for blood pressure control in primary care was associated with an 8.8% increase in the proportion of participants achieving individual targets and 9.5% increase in those achieving the classic target of â‰_140/90 mm Hg"
PMC3502035,S226,,"Despite parallel reductions in absolute cardiovascular risk, achieving more stringent blood pressure targets remains a challenge"
PMC3502035,S227,,Modification of treatment owing to adverse events was more common in the intervention group than usual care group (7.9% v 1.9%)

PMC3551223,S2,,Adding tocilizumab or switching to tocilizumab monotherapy in methotrexate inadequate responders: 24-week symptomatic and structural results of a 2-year randomised controlled strategy trial in rheumatoid arthritis (ACT-RAY)
PMC3551223,S3,,Abstract
PMC3551223,S4,,Objective
PMC3551223,S5,,"In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate, to compare the efficacy of adding tocilizumab to that of switching to tocilizumab monotherapy."
PMC3551223,S6,,Methods
PMC3551223,S7,,"Double-blind, 2-year study in which adults with active RA (DAS28 >4.4) despite methotrexate were randomly assigned either to continue methotrexate with the addition of tocilizumab (MTX+TCZ) 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks or switch to tocilizumab and placebo (TCZ+PBO)."
PMC3551223,S8,,The primary endpoint was the DAS28â€“erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) remission rate at week 24.
PMC3551223,S9,,"Secondary objectives included other symptomatic outcomes, quality of life and progression of structural damage."
PMC3551223,S10,,Results
PMC3551223,S11,,"Of 556 randomly assigned patients, 512 (92%) completed 24 weeks."
PMC3551223,S12,,DAS28â€“ESR remission rates were 40.4% for TCZ+MTX and 34.8% for TCZ+PBO (p=0.19); American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70/90 rates were 71.5%/45.5%/24.5%/5.8% (TCZ+MTX) and 70.3%/40.2%/25.4%/5.1% (TCZ+PBO; differences not significant).
PMC3551223,S13,,A significant difference between groups was seen for low DAS28 (61.7% vs 51.4%).
PMC3551223,S14,,Radiographic progression was small and not different between groups (Genantâ€“Sharp score progression â‰_ smallest detectable change in 91% (TCZ+MTX) and 87% (TCZ+PBO)).
PMC3551223,S15,,"Rates per 100 patient-years of serious adverse events and serious infections were 21 and six, respectively, for TCZ+MTX and 18 and six, respectively, for TCZ+PBO."
PMC3551223,S16,,"Alanine aminotransferase elevations greater than threefold the upper limit of normal occurred in 7.8% and 1.2% of TCZ+MTX and TCZ+PBO patients, respectively."
PMC3551223,S17,,Conclusion
PMC3551223,S18,,No clinically relevant superiority of the TCZ+MTX add-on strategy over the switch to tocilizumab monotherapy strategy was observed.
PMC3551223,S19,,The combination was more commonly associated with transaminase increases.
PMC3551223,S20,,"Meaningful clinical and radiographic responses were achieved with both strategies, suggesting that tocilizumab monotherapy might be a valuable treatment strategy in suitable RA patients."
PMC3551223,S21,,"One of the major long-term objectives of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment is to prevent functional impairment as a result of bone damage, tendon or ligament rupture and cartilage breakdown."
PMC3551223,S22,,Persistent inflammation at the level of the joint (synovitis and osteitis) or the whole body (reflected in acute phase reactants) is among the most important predictors of subsequent structural deterioration.1
PMC3551223,S23,,"Inflammation is also responsible for symptoms such as pain, fatigue and disability that impair the patient's quality of life.2"
PMC3551223,S24,,Structural deterioration can be evaluated over months using radiological scoring systems.3
PMC3551223,S25,,"Therefore, the short-term objective of RA treatment is to improve the patient's condition by abrogating inflammation and by sustaining this, thereby achieving the longer term objective of stopping radiological progression.1"
PMC3551223,S26,,Methotrexate is considered the cornerstone of therapy to achieve this goal.
PMC3551223,S27,,"When there is inadequate disease control with methotrexate alone, the current recommendation is to add a tumour necrosis factor blocker or another approved biological agent.4"
PMC3551223,S28,,"However, as evidenced by registries of routine clinical practice treatment, approximately one third of RA patients are being treated with biological monotherapy, that is without concomitant methotrexate.5 6"
PMC3551223,S29,,There are many reasons for stopping methotrexate or initiating biological agents as a monotherapy.
PMC3551223,S30,,"In daily practice, frequent methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal disorders (eg, nausea) have been reported as leading to poor patient compliance.7"
PMC3551223,S31,,"Moreover, the use of methotrexate may lead to other safety issues such as haematological and hepatic adverse events."
PMC3551223,S32,,"Such limitations explain why it is important to evaluate a switch strategy to biological monotherapy in addition to traditional add-on strategies (ie, the addition of a biological agent to methotrexate)."
PMC3551223,S33,,"Tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody8 has proved its efficacy and safety in RA patients continuing to receive methotrexate9 10 and as biological monotherapy.11"
PMC3551223,S34,,The latter is supported by data from a head-to-head trial showing that tocilizumab was more efficacious than methotrexate in patients who had not failed previous treatment with methotrexate or biological agents.12
PMC3551223,S35,,"Because methotrexate is the current recommended first-line therapy, the question arises as to whether tocilizumab should be added to methotrexate (add-on strategy) or methotrexate could be stopped when commencing tocilizumab (switch strategy) in patients with inadequately controlled disease."
PMC3551223,S36,,The only data comparing the two strategies is from a phase II study with a small sample size and no structural outcome measures to indicate the superiority of the add-on strategy.13
PMC3551223,S37,,We therefore conducted a 2-year trial with the objective of assessing the efficacy and safety profile of either adding tocilizumab to methotrexate or switching methotrexate to tocilizumab monotherapy in patients with persistent active disease despite methotrexate therapy.

PMC3551223,S122,,Overall rates per 100 patient-years of AE and serious AE were similar between groups.
PMC3551223,S123,,"A total of 17 patients (6.1%) in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate group and 16 patients (5.8%) in the tocilizumab plus placebo group experienced serious AE, the most common of which were infections (seven events in each group) and cardiac disorders (three and four events in the two groups, respectively)."
PMC3551223,S124,,There was a total of three deaths in the first 24 weeks and a fourth patient died from an AE that started within the first 24 weeks (two each in either group).
PMC3551223,S125,,"The causes of death in these four patients were: sepsis; septic shock preceded by scrotal abscess, skin necrosis, acute renal failure and congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction; and sepsis with meningitis."
PMC3551223,S126,,"AE-related discontinuations and dose modifications occurred in 3.6% and 27.4% of tocilizumab plus methotrexate patients and 2.5% and 18.5% of tocilizumab plus placebo patients, respectively."

PMC3551223,S129,,"For aspartate transaminase, such elevations occurred in 34.2% and 1.9% (tocilizumab plus methotrexate) and in 19.2% and 0.4% (tocilizumab plus placebo) of patients, respectively, indicating a trend towards lower rates of liver enzyme elevations with tocilizumab monotherapy."
PMC3551223,S130,,"As seen in previous studies with tocilizumab and also with other anti-inflammatory treatments, mean total cholesterol levels increased from 93.1 and 92.7 mg/dl at baseline to 102.4 and 103.5 mg/dl at week 24 in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate and tocilizumab plus placebo groups, respectively."
PMC3551223,S131,,Discussion
PMC3551223,S132,,This study evaluated two different tocilizumab-based treatment strategies in patients with active RA and suggests that a clinically relevant effect with arrest of structural progression is observed at 24 weeks with both treatment strategies in the majority of patients.
PMC3551223,S133,,"The study did not succeed at demonstrating that add-on strategy efficacy (combination therapy of tocilizumab plus methotrexate) was superior to the switch strategy (monotherapy tocilizumab plus placebo), although there were numerically small and not clinically meaningful differences in the primary and some secondary efficacy endpoints in favour of combination therapy."
PMC3551223,S134,,"No differences were observed in safety, the exception being that the add-on strategy resulted in a numerically higher percentage of patients who had transaminase level increases compared with the switch strategy."
PMC3551223,S135,,This is the first study comparing the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate and as monotherapy in inadequate responders to methotrexate with a sufficient sample size to address this question prospectively.
PMC3551223,S136,,The primary outcome measure (DAS28â€“ESR remission rate at 24 weeks) did not differ significantly between the two strategies.
PMC3551223,S137,,"With the exception of the proportion of patients with low disease activity (DAS28â€“ESR <3.2) at 24 weeks, the secondary efficacy analyses supported the primary endpoint by not showing a between-group statistically significant difference."
PMC3551223,S138,,This interpretation is also supported by the changes over time in individual parameters (figure 2).
PMC3551223,S139,,"Looking at the overall picture across different endpoints and time points there was a trend towards slightly higher responses with the add-on strategy (eg, 5.6% difference in DAS28 remission and 3.3% difference in patients with no radiological progression greater than SDC)."
PMC3551223,S140,,Looking at the effect sizes and the fact that most of the differences are not statistically significant the trend in favour of the add-on strategy is considered clinically not meaningful.
PMC3551223,S141,,"As the study did not succeed at demonstrating the superiority of the add-on versus the switch strategy, we discuss here factors that could potentially have biased the study outcome, before rejecting the clinical study hypothesis."
PMC3551223,S142,,"The study was powered to detect a 12.5% difference in DAS28â€“ESR remission rates at week 24 between the two arms, which is the minimum difference that the scientific steering committee considered to be clinically meaningful."
PMC3551223,S143,,"This choice was supported by CHARISMA, a phase II dose-finding study, which indicated that combination therapy of tocilizumab with methotrexate might be superior to monotherapy (eg, DAS28 remission at week 16 achieved by 34% of combination therapy and 17% of monotherapy patients).13"
PMC3551223,S144,,Based on the number of patients actually randomly assigned and the observed remission rate in the tocilizumab plus placebo arm the study was factually able to detect a difference of approximately 11% between the two strategies and as such had adequate discriminative power for a relevant treatment difference.
PMC3551223,S145,,"The patients were selected based on the established definition of RA and their baseline characteristics were in concordance with earlier studies with tocilizumab or other biological agents, and were well balanced between the treatment arms."
PMC3551223,S146,,"The only notable exception was baseline GSS, which showed more advanced structural damage in the switch group."
PMC3551223,S147,,The doses of both methotrexate/placebo and tocilizumab were in line with approved labels.
PMC3551223,S148,,"Furthermore, the methotrexate/placebo doses were similar between trial arms (table 1) and consistent with previous clinical trials evaluating combination methotrexate plus biological agent treatment16â€“20 as well as with commonly prescribed methotrexate doses in clinical practice.21â€“23"
PMC3551223,S149,,"However, methotrexate/placebo doses were lower than in some current recommendations for the optimisation of methotrexate.24 25"
PMC3551223,S150,,"In the absence of any methodological bias that could have artificially reduced the difference in efficacy between the two arms, we conclude that the answer to the question asked in the study â€˜Is the add-on strategy superior to the switch to monotherapy strategy?â€™ is â€˜noâ€™ so that one could suggest that both strategies provide a similar benefit in terms of clinical and structural outcomes."
PMC3551223,S151,,"Safety outcomes were similar in the two arms, except for a numerically higher rate of increased transaminase levels with the add-on strategy."
PMC3551223,S152,,"Overall, the incidence of events such as serious AE, serious infections and discontinuations was similar between the add-on and switch strategies, consistent with previous tocilizumab studies."
PMC3551223,S153,,The data observed in this study suggest that tocilizumab monotherapy may be a valuable treatment strategy for certain RA patients requiring biological agents.
PMC3551223,S154,,"In particular, patients with a contraindication or intolerance to methotrexate are likely to be a suitable population."
PMC3551223,S155,,"Further confirmation of these data is required, including through the longer term observation of the patients recruited for this study as well as additional studies in other patient sets including the evaluation in daily practice via registries."

PMC3590447,S3,,Summary
PMC3590447,S4,,Background
PMC3590447,S5,,Membranous nephropathy leads to end-stage renal disease in more than 20% of patients.
PMC3590447,S6,,"Although immunosuppressive therapy benefits some patients, trial evidence for the subset of patients with declining renal function is not available."
PMC3590447,S7,,We aimed to assess whether immunosuppression preserves renal function in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy with declining renal function.
PMC3590447,S8,,Methods
PMC3590447,S9,,This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 37 renal units across the UK.
PMC3590447,S10,,"We recruited patients (18â€“75 years) with biopsy-proven idiopathic membranous nephropathy, a plasma creatinine concentration of less than 300 Î_mol/L, and at least a 20% decline in excretory renal function measured in the 2 years before study entry, based on at least three measurements over a period of 3 months or longer."
PMC3590447,S11,,"Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by a random number table to receive supportive treatment only, supportive treatment plus 6 months of alternating cycles of prednisolone and chlorambucil, or supportive treatment plus 12 months of ciclosporin."
PMC3590447,S12,,"The primary outcome was a further 20% decline in renal function from baseline, analysed by intention to treat."
PMC3590447,S13,,"The trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number 99959692."
PMC3590447,S14,,Findings
PMC3590447,S15,,"We randomly assigned 108 patients, 33 of whom received prednisolone and chlorambucil, 37 ciclosporin, and 38 supportive therapy alone."
PMC3590447,S16,,"Two patients (one who received ciclosporin and one who received supportive therapy) were ineligible, so were not included in the intention-to-treat analysis, and 45 patients deviated from protocol before study end, mostly as a result of minor dose adjustments."
PMC3590447,S17,,Follow up was until primary endpoint or for minimum of 3 years if primary endpoint was not reached.
PMC3590447,S18,,"Risk of further 20% decline in renal function was significantly lower in the prednisolone and chlorambucil group than in the supportive care group (19 [58%] of 33 patients reached endpoint vs 31 [84%] of 37, hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·44 [95% CI 0Â·24â€“0Â·78]; p=0Â·0042); risk did not differ between the ciclosporin (29 [81%] of 36) and supportive treatment only groups (HR 1Â·17 [0Â·70â€“1Â·95]; p=0Â·54), but did differ significantly across all three groups (p=0Â·003)."
PMC3590447,S19,,Serious adverse events were frequent in all three groups but were higher in the prednisolone and chlorambucil group than in the supportive care only group (56 events vs 24 events; p=0Â·048).
PMC3590447,S20,,Interpretation
PMC3590447,S21,,"For the subset of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy and deteriorating excretory renal function, 6 months' therapy with prednisolone and chlorambucil is the treatment approach best supported by our evidence."

PMC3590447,S25,,Introduction
PMC3590447,S26,,"Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in adults, and according to figures from the Netherlands,1 30â€“50 people per million population develop the disorder every 5 years (6â€“10 per million population per year)."
PMC3590447,S27,,"Membranous nephropathy results in substantial morbidity and is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, which accounted for expenditure of US$40 billion in the USA in 2008.2"
PMC3590447,S28,,"Optimum treatment for membranous nephropathy is controversial despite several controlled trials having assessed available treatments, not least because the disorder has a variable natural history and many severely affected individuals can undergo spontaneous remission."
PMC3590447,S29,,"Only a subset of patients (25â€“30% in most series) develops progressive loss of kidney function, and since available therapies have substantial adverse effects, some believe that aggressive therapy should be reserved for this subgroup.3,4"
PMC3590447,S30,,"However, no large prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this worst-affected subset exist."
PMC3590447,S31,,"Studies of the natural history of membranous nephropathy show that once excretory renal function starts to decline, continued deterioration can be expected,5 which suggests that the really important clinical question in membranous nephropathy is whether treatments that are effective in less severely affected patients are also beneficial in patients showing definite signs of decline in renal function.6,7"
PMC3590447,S32,,"Thus, findings from prospective RCTs are essential to inform decisions about treatment of this disorder."
PMC3590447,S33,,Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is often managed with immunosuppressive drugs.
PMC3590447,S34,,"Until recently, evidence that this nephropathy is autoimmune in origin was circumstantial.8"
PMC3590447,S35,,"However, autoantibodies to the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R1) have now been noted in most affected individuals,9 and a predisposition to the disorder has been very strongly linked to two genetic regions (one in the MHC and the other in the PLA2R1 gene itself10)â€”findings that support an immunological pathogenesis and provide a rationale for immunosuppressive therapy, especially treatment targeted at B lymphocytes."
PMC3590447,S36,,"When our study was designed, combined treatment with prednisolone and chlorambucil11 and single-agent therapy with ciclosporin were supported by RCT evidence.12"
PMC3590447,S37,,We did a questionnaire survey as part of our preliminary research and noted that nephrologists were uncertain about the relative risks of intervention with immunosuppressive therapy compared with supportive therapy alone.
PMC3590447,S38,,"Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that immunosuppressive therapy, either with prednisolone and chlorambucil or with ciclosporin, preserves renal function in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy with declining renal function compared with supportive therapy alone."

PMC3590447,S136,,"We acknowledge that some potential adverse effects of prednisolone plus chlorambucil and ciclosporin are more longlasting than the effects reported with supportive care alone, especially the risk of lymphoma or other malignant diseases."
PMC3590447,S137,,Discussion
PMC3590447,S138,,These results suggest that supportive therapy plus prednisolone and chlorambucil is better at prevention of decline in excretory renal function than is supportive therapy plus ciclosporin or supportive therapy alone in patients with deteriorating function due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy.
PMC3590447,S139,,"Ideally the results should be confirmed in a larger study, but because this trial took 10 years to recruit due to the difficulty of running a multicentre trial in slowly progressive glomerular disease, a similar larger study is unlikely to be done."
PMC3590447,S140,,"92% of all patients in this trial received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, showing that this aspect of supportive therapy was virtually universal in all three groups."
PMC3590447,S141,,The benefit to renal function was matched by a reduction in proteinuria with prednisolone and chlorambucil.
PMC3590447,S142,,"In this severely affected subset of patients, we thought it would be unlikely that even responders would achieve complete remission of proteinuria, hence our decision to make excretory renal function our primary endpoint."
PMC3590447,S143,,"Adverse events were frequent, including in the supportive therapy group, suggesting that this group of patients is susceptible to major medical problems."
PMC3590447,S144,,"Masking was impossible because of the nature of the treatments involved, but we accept that the fact that the study was unblinded might have affected the reporting of adverse effects."
PMC3590447,S145,,"In the active intervention groups, the serious adverse effects were predictable from the side-effect profiles of the drugsâ€”particularly headache, tremor, hypertension, deterioration in renal function, or infection in the ciclosporin group and predominantly haematological (especially leucopenia and anaemia) or metabolic (especially glucose intolerance) effects in the prednisolone and chlorambucil group."
PMC3590447,S146,,"Dose adjustment of chlorambucil arose frequently and treatment interruptions were common, both accounting for most of the protocol departures in the prednisolone and chlorambucil group."
PMC3590447,S147,,"Similarly, in the ciclosporin group, nephrotoxicity was a substantial problem despite the fact that we used target blood concentrations advocated in a previous RCT;12 dose reductions, treatment interruptions, and reaching of primary endpoint were frequent in this group."
PMC3590447,S148,,"Slow trial recruitment was undoubtedly determined by the eligibility criteria: deteriorating renal function in idiopathic membranous nephropathy has become less common with angiotensin-cascade blockade and other aspects of supportive management,16 and our detailed communications with renal units throughout the UK during the trial showed that the rarity of eligible patients was the main barrier to recruitment."
PMC3590447,S149,,"Of the 37 units that entered patients, 31 recruited four patients or fewer."
PMC3590447,S150,,"Renal units that declined to participate and apply for ethical approval were roughly equally divided into those concerned about the lack of active therapy in the supportive care only group or the potential toxicity of active therapyâ€”clear evidence that considerable uncertainty surrounds appropriate management of this disorder, and that a definitive RCT is needed."
PMC3590447,S151,,"We contend that for patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, 6 months' therapy with alternating monthly cycles of prednisolone and chlorambucil is the treatment approach best supported by evidence, and our study extends this evidence to the important subset of patients with membranous nephropathy and deteriorating excretory renal function."
PMC3590447,S152,,Our findings do not support the use of ciclosporin in this groupâ€”the adverse effects on renal function make it unsuitable once renal function has started to decline.
PMC3590447,S153,,The ciclosporin starting dose in our study was based on an RCT reported by Cattran and colleagues.12
PMC3590447,S154,,A later trial led by this group17 used a lower starting dose (3Â·5 mg/kg per day) but aimed for similar plasma concentrations and reported beneficial effects on proteinuria.
PMC3590447,S155,,"Other investigators have used a lower dose of ciclosporin in small uncontrolled studies and also reported beneficial effects for proteinuria.18,19"
PMC3590447,S156,,"Shortly after our study started, Ponticelli and colleagues20 reported that the choice of alkylating agent (between chlorambucil and the more familiar cyclophosphamide) for idiopathic membranous nephropathy might be immaterial, although cyclophosphamide might be less toxic."
PMC3590447,S157,,"We decided not to change our study design, but we agree that cyclophosphamide could probably be substituted for chlorambucil."
PMC3590447,S158,,"Uncontrolled studies using a combination of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide in severely affected patients have led to similar conclusions,1,21 and one RCT supports this approach in patients with well preserved renal function at entry.22"
PMC3590447,S159,,Our study shows that this form of therapy can still be effective in patients whose renal function has started to deteriorate.
PMC3590447,S160,,"The use of alkylating agents (with their potent effects on B lymphocytes) for idiopathic membranous nephropathy has a rationale now that autoantibodies to PLA2R1 have been discovered in most patients.8,9"
PMC3590447,S161,,"Immunosuppressive therapy is also logical in view of our previously published analysis of the genetic basis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy,10 showing that two genes predispose white people to this disorder, an immune-response gene in the HLA-DQA1 region and the PLA2R1 gene itself."
PMC3590447,S162,,"Rituximab for idiopathic membranous nephropathy has shown promise,23,24 but so far evidence for its effectiveness is not based on RCT data and the beneficial effects are mostly in reduction of proteinuria rather than preservation of excretory renal function."
PMC3590447,S163,,"Furthermore, rituximab is expensive and is associated with important long-term safety concerns such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.25"
PMC3590447,S164,,"However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has not been reported in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy given rituximab and might be associated with intensity of immunosuppression, since patients who got the disease received rituximab together with other agents."
PMC3590447,S165,,"Future RCTs should assess the cost-effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of rituximab for patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, perhaps compared with prednisolone plus an alkylating agent (either cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil)."
PMC3590447,S166,,"Future trials should ideally include patient-reported outcomes and an analysis of the balance between treatment costs (including those associated with adverse effects) and costs of renal replacement therapy in untreated patients, so that the costâ€“benefit of delaying the need for renal replacement therapy and quality-of-life issues can be assessed."
PMC3590447,S167,,"Adverse effects, particularly haematological outcomes, were common in patients given prednisolone and chlorambucil in our study and often necessitated dose reduction or interruption of therapy."
PMC3590447,S168,,"Clearly, the preservation of renal function that can be achieved with prednisolone and chlorambucil comes at a price, and careful monitoring of the therapy is needed."

PMC3590447,S175,,This study is the first to focus on the important subset of patients with membranous nephropathy whose excretory renal function is deteriorating.

PMC3590447,S178,,"The protection of renal function offered by prednisolone and chlorambucil comes at a price, so this therapy needs to be closely monitored."
PMC3590447,S179,,Benefits of prednisolone and chlorambucil were maintained for at least 3 years of follow-up.
PMC3590447,S180,,"Delaying end-stage renal disease, with its associated cardiovascular risk and increased morbidity and mortality, is of undoubted value to patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy."
PMC3590447,S181,,"However, even in patients given prednisolone and chlorambucil, only 40% had not had a further 20% decline in excretory renal function at 3 years."
PMC3590447,S182,,"Clearly, more effective and safer forms of therapy are still needed for idiopathic membranous nephropathy."
PMC3590447,S183,,"Until new treatments are available and have been properly tested, the evidence favours use of prednisolone and an alkylating agent in the most severely affected patients."
PMC3590447,S184,,"This conclusion, and the lack of good RCTs in nephrology to address this and similar questions, are supported by a Cochrane review of the subject26 and an authoritative review of the international scientific literature on the treatment of glomerulonephritis (panel).27"
PMC3590447,S185,,"The supportive therapy only group effectively continued current treatment whereas the two intervention groups received new treatment, which led to some minor differences in the time between randomisation and baseline readings (ie, initiation of treatment); however, the time differences were small in the context of this slowly progressive disease in comparison with the length of follow-up, and as a result the risk of bias is small."
PMC3590447,S186,,Recruitment was very slow and the trial was designed over 14 years ago.
PMC3590447,S187,,"However, we believe that the trial results are still relevant, not least because few RCTs of drugs for this disease have been done, with none in the subset of patients with deteriorating excretory renal function."
PMC3590447,S188,,"One aspect of the slow recruitment was the changes in methods that became established during the trial, both for estimation of excretory kidney function and assessment of proteinuria."
PMC3590447,S189,,We used one consistent method for the calculation of primary endpoints.
PMC3590447,S190,,We did not use gold-standard methods of measuring kidney function such as isotope clearance studies.
PMC3590447,S191,,"These methods are expensive and invasive, and although our trial depended on estimations, we believe it is relevant to everyday clinical practice since we used standard estimation techniques that are used in nephrology practice worldwide."
PMC3590447,S192,,"In this study we assessed ciclosporin monotherapy and noted that the drug's nephrotoxicity, even at blood concentrations advocated in a previous RCT,12,15 was harmful in the severely affected subset that we selected."
PMC3590447,S193,,"Some physicians advocate use of ciclosporin together with prednisolone, but we know of no good evidence that this combination reduces renal toxicity."
PMC3590447,S194,,"We need to follow up these patients for even longer to absolutely assess the value of the delay to end-stage renal disease that we noted in the prednisolone and chlorambucil group and to gather longer-term data for delayed adverse effects in the two intervention groups, especially lymphomas and other malignancies."

PMC3623038,S4,,Background
PMC3623038,S5,,"Given that memantine is thought to decrease N-methyl-D-aspartic-acid-related (NMDA) glutamatergic hyperactivity and improve locomotion in rats, we sought to assess the drug's impact on axial symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD)."
PMC3623038,S6,,Methods
PMC3623038,S7,,"We performed a 90-day, randomised, double-blind, study with two parallel arms: 20 mg/day memantine versus placebo (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01108029)."
PMC3623038,S8,,"The main inclusion criterion was the presence of a severe gait disorder and an abnormal, forward-leaning stance."
PMC3623038,S9,,"The following parameters were analysed under standardised conditions before and after acute administration of L-dopa: gait (stride length as primary criterion), the United-Parkinson's-Disease-Rating-Scale (UPDRS) motor score and its axial subscore, the hypertonia and strength of the axial extensors and flexors (isokinetic dynamometer), the Dyskinesia Rating Scale score (DRS) and its axial subscore."
PMC3623038,S10,,Results
PMC3623038,S11,,Twenty-five patients were included.
PMC3623038,S12,,The memantine and placebo group did not differ significantly in terms of stride length.
PMC3623038,S13,,"However, in the memantine group, we observed significantly better results (vs placebo) for the overall UPDRS score (F(1,21)=4.9; p=0.039(âˆ’1)) and its axial subscore (F(1,21)=7.2; p=0.014(âˆ’1.1)), axial hypertonia, the axial and overall DRS and axial strength."
PMC3623038,S14,,Conclusions
PMC3623038,S15,,Memantine treatment was associated with lower axial motor symptom and dyskinesia scores but did not improve gait.
PMC3623038,S16,,These benefits must be confirmed in a broader population of patients.

PMC3623038,S18,,"In late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), axial signs (notably with gait disorders, such as hypokinesia), abnormal posture, falls and poor balance reduce personal independence and may prompt institutionalisation."

PMC3623038,S92,,Discussion
PMC3623038,S93,,"Our randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study showed for the first time that a combination of memantine and L-dopa was associated with a slight, beneficial effect on axial motor handicap and LID in advanced PD patients with severe axial symptoms."
PMC3623038,S94,,"Memantine's good safety profile and its observed association with a lower motor symptom score (vs placebo) confirmed the findings of two open-label studies12 13 and two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies."
PMC3623038,S95,,One of the double-blind studies used non-validated scales14 and the other adopted a crossover paradigm with a very small number (n=12) of PD patients.15
PMC3623038,S96,,This pilot study had both strengths and limitations.
PMC3623038,S97,,"The main limitation was the small sample size, which encompassed patients with and without STN stimulation."
PMC3623038,S98,,"However, the lack of significant differences between these subgroups suggests that memantine may have clinical benefit in both stimulated and non-stimulated patients."
PMC3623038,S99,,"Furthermore, the lack of â€˜off-L-dopaâ€™ data (due to handicap in patients with very advanced disease) prevented us from interpreting the effect of memantine in the absence of L-dopa."
PMC3623038,S100,,"In contrast, the study had a number of key strengths: it featured a double-blind, placebo-controlled design and (in order to compensate for the small sample size) highly sensitive measurement techniques under standardised assessment conditions."
PMC3623038,S101,,The memantine and placebo group did not differ significantly in terms of stride length (the study's primary efficacy criterion) and other gait parameters assessed with a sensitive optoelectronic system.
PMC3623038,S102,,The small observed effect size suggests that gait might not even be improved in future studies with a larger sample size population.
PMC3623038,S103,,We also failed to detect any significant differences (vs placebo) in attention (as assessed by measuring reaction times: data not shown) or sleepiness in patients taking their usual dopaminergic medication.
PMC3623038,S104,,Axial motor signs (as judged by the UPDRS axial subscore) were significantly lower in the memantine group than in the placebo group.
PMC3623038,S105,,"This clinical benefit was associated with an improvement in axial rigidity and strength, as measured with an isokinetic dynamometer."
PMC3623038,S106,,"Relative to placebo, both LID of the limbs and axial LID were less intense in the memantine group."
PMC3623038,S107,,"Little is known about memantine's effect on LIDâ€”in contrast to amantadine, another NMDA receptor antagonistâ€”because placebo-controlled studies on this topic are lacking."
PMC3623038,S108,,The beneficial effect of memantine may be due to a decrease in the excessive synaptic noise caused by overactivation of NMDA receptorsâ€”notably those in the descending subthalamo-entopeduncular pathway.2â€“4
PMC3623038,S109,,This short-term effect might have a favourable longer-term impact on posture.
PMC3623038,S110,,"Memantine might decrease trunk flexor rigidity (limiting the abnormal, forward-leaning stance) and increase axial extensor strength (limiting extensor under-use and thus slowing the development of the progressive amyotrophy that notably occurs in parkinsonian camptocormia)."

PMC3641608,S2,,Routine versus clinically driven laboratory monitoring and first-line antiretroviral therapy strategies in African children with HIV (ARROW): a 5-year open-label randomised factorial trial
PMC3641608,S3,,Summary
PMC3641608,S4,,Background
PMC3641608,S5,,"No trials have investigated routine laboratory monitoring for children with HIV, nor four-drug induction strategies to increase durability of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART)."
PMC3641608,S6,,Methods
PMC3641608,S7,,"In this open-label parallel-group trial, Ugandan and Zimbabwean children or adolescents with HIV, aged 3 months to 17 years and eligible for ART, were randomly assigned in a factorial design."
PMC3641608,S8,,"Randomisation was to either clinically driven monitoring or routine laboratory and clinical monitoring for toxicity (haematology and biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4 cell counts; non-inferiority monitoring randomisation); and simultaneously to standard three-drug or to four-drug induction first-line ART, in three groups: three-drug treatment (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], lamivudine, abacavir; group A) versus four-drug induction (NNRTI, lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine; groups B and C), decreasing after week 36 to three-drug NNRTI, lamivudine, plus abacavir (group B) or lamivudine, abacavir, plus zidovudine (group C; superiority ART-strategy randomisation)."
PMC3641608,S9,,"For patients assigned to routine laboratory monitoring, results were returned every 12 weeks to clinicians; for clinically driven monitoring, toxicity results were only returned for requested clinical reasons or if grade 4."
PMC3641608,S10,,Children switched to second-line ART for WHO stage 3 or 4 events or (routine laboratory monitoring only) age-dependent WHO CD4 criteria.
PMC3641608,S11,,Randomisation used computer-generated sequentially numbered tables incorporated securely within the database.
PMC3641608,S12,,Primary efficacy endpoints were new WHO stage 4 events or death for monitoring and change in CD4 percentage at 72 and 144 weeks for ART-strategy randomisations; the co-primary toxicity endpoint was grade 3 or 4 adverse events.
PMC3641608,S13,,Analysis was by intention to treat.
PMC3641608,S14,,"This trial is registered, ISRCTN24791884."
PMC3641608,S15,,Findings
PMC3641608,S16,,"1206 children were randomly assigned to clinically driven (n=606) versus routine laboratory monitoring (n=600), and groups A (n=397), B (n=404), and C (n=405)."
PMC3641608,S17,,"47 (8%) children on clinically driven monitoring versus 39 (7%) on routine laboratory monitoring had a new WHO stage 4 event or died (hazard ratio [HR] 1Â·13, 95% CI 0Â·73â€“1Â·73, p=0Â·59; non-inferiority criterion met)."
PMC3641608,S18,,"However, in years 2â€“5, rates were higher in children on clinically driven monitoring (1Â·3 vs 0Â·4 per 100 child-years, difference 0Â·99, 0Â·37â€“1Â·60, p=0Â·002)."
PMC3641608,S19,,"One or more grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 283 (47%) children on clinically driven versus 282 (47%) on routine laboratory monitoring (HR 0Â·98, 0Â·83â€“1Â·16, p=0Â·83)."
PMC3641608,S20,,"Mean CD4 percentage change did not differ between ART groups at week 72 (16Â·5% [SD 8Â·6] vs 17Â·1% [8Â·5] vs 17Â·3% [8Â·0], p=0Â·33) or week 144 (p=0Â·69), but four-drug groups (B, C) were superior to three-drug group A at week 36 (12Â·4% [7Â·2] vs 14Â·1% [7Â·1] vs 14Â·6% [7Â·3], p<0Â·0001)."
PMC3641608,S21,,"Excess grade 3 or 4 events in groups B (one or more events reported by 157 [40%] children in A, 190 [47%] in B; HR [B:A] 1Â·32, 1Â·07â€“1Â·63) and C (218 [54%] children in C; HR [C:A] 1Â·58, 1Â·29â€“1Â·94; global p=0Â·0001) were driven by asymptomatic neutropenia in zidovudine-containing groups (B, C; 86 group A, 133 group B, 184 group C), but resulted in drug substitutions in only zero versus two versus four children, respectively."
PMC3641608,S22,,Interpretation
PMC3641608,S23,,"NNRTI plus NRTI-based three-drug or four-drug ART can be given across childhood without routine toxicity monitoring; CD4 monitoring provided clinical benefit after the first year on ART, but event rates were very low and long-term survival high, suggesting ART rollout should take priority."
PMC3641608,S24,,"CD4 benefits from four-drug induction were not durable, but three-NRTI long-term maintenance was immunologically and clinically similar to NNRTI-based ART and could be valuable during tuberculosis co-treatment."

PMC3641608,S27,,Introduction
PMC3641608,S28,,"In high-income countries, routine laboratory tests are done (typically every 3â€“4 months) to monitor efficacy (HIV viral load, CD4 counts) and toxicity (haematology or biochemistry panels) in patients with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART)."
PMC3641608,S29,,"Although not mandated when public health ART rollout started,1 the extent to which HIV treatment programmes in resource-limited settings should provide routine laboratory monitoring versus focus resources on expanding ART access for the many in need, remains an ongoing debate, particularly relevant with slowing growth in health assistance for resource-limited countries in the current economic crisis.2"
PMC3641608,S30,,"90% of children with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa; in 2011, only about 28% of those needing ART were receiving it.3"
PMC3641608,S31,,"Infrastructure, personnel, and supply chain constraints all affect the ability to monitor, and tests for detecting toxicity and measuring efficacy are generally unavailable, particularly at low-level facilities.4"
PMC3641608,S32,,Trials in adults have compared routine laboratory with clinical monitoring on ART.5â€“8
PMC3641608,S33,,"These showed no benefit from routine toxicity monitoring,5 small but significant benefits from CD4 monitoring,5,8 and no significant additional benefit of viral load over CD4 monitoring.6,8"
PMC3641608,S34,,"No trials have evaluated monitoring strategies in children on ART; results in adults might not be generalisable because of differences in frequency of ART toxicity, predictive value of CD4s,9,10 and the clinical spectrum of paediatric HIV and its comorbidities, particularly in Africa.11"
PMC3641608,S35,,Children with HIV start ART early and will need to take treatment for longer than adults.
PMC3641608,S36,,"Challenges in treatment of young children, in whom viral loads are higher, pharmacokinetics more variable, and adherence more challenging, might account for the lower virological suppression rates in children compared with adults in similar calendar periods.12,13"
PMC3641608,S37,,"However, four-drug combinations (generally three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) have been reported to show superior virological and immunological responses compared with three-drug ART (two NRTIs plus one NNRTI or protease inhibitor) in an observational study in infants.14"
PMC3641608,S38,,Whether addition of one drug for a short period in an induction-maintenance approach might have benefits across childhood is unknown.
PMC3641608,S39,,"A key advantage might be more rapid reduction of high viral loads in ART-naive children, which could have long-term benefits."
PMC3641608,S40,,"A triple NRTI regimen after four-drug NRTI plus NNRTI induction also avoids challenges of managing interactions with antituberculosis drugs, particularly for young children unable to take efavirenz."
PMC3641608,S41,,We therefore undertook the first paediatric trial (AntiRetroviral Research fOr Watoto [ARROW]) to evaluate the long-term effect of routine efficacy and toxicity monitoring and different first-line ART strategies in a factorial design in African children.

PMC3641608,S103,,Baseline characteristics were similar across randomised groups (table 1).
PMC3641608,S104,,"Median follow-up to planned trial closure (March 16, 2012) was 4Â·0 (IQR 3Â·7â€“4Â·4) years in each monitoring and ART-strategy group (maximum 5Â·0 years; total 4685 child-years)."
PMC3641608,S105,,Only 33 (3%) children (median follow-up 150 [IQR 46â€“169] weeks) not known to have died were not seen after trial closure (figure 1).
PMC3641608,S106,,"Completeness of nurse visits every 4â€“6 weeks and doctor visits every 12 weeks was more than 95% (46â€ˆ531/48â€ˆ461 nurse, 19â€ˆ088/19â€ˆ765 doctor visits) and was similar in all groups."
PMC3641608,S107,,"For children assigned to clinically driven monitoring, clinicians could request individual laboratory toxicity results from routine haematology or biochemistry panels for clinical reasons."
PMC3641608,S108,,Panel tests could also be requested in both groups at extra patient-initiated visits.
PMC3641608,S109,,"However, most were done at routine visits (10â€ˆ805 [92%] haematology and 10â€ˆ778 [94%] biochemistry; appendix)."
PMC3641608,S110,,"In clinically driven monitoring, apart from week 8 haemoglobin (returned per protocol), very few results were released (from 486 [4%] panels); most commonly requested results were haemoglobin (2%, n=265) and neutrophils (3%, n=323; appendix)."
PMC3641608,S111,,"More additional haematology tests were requested during nurse visits or extra visits in routine laboratory than in clinically driven monitoring (p<0Â·0001); there were no significant differences in requests for additional biochemistry tests (p=0Â·17) or other non-routine (eg, electrolytes) tests (p=0Â·97)."

PMC3641608,S114,,"Among 151 first-line drug changes, equal numbers were due to adverse events and antituberculosis therapy (both 59 changes [39%]; table 2)."
PMC3641608,S115,,"Changes to first-line therapy occurred at rates of 3Â·3 per 100 child-years in routine laboratory monitoring versus 3Â·2 per 100 child-years in clinically driven monitoring (p=0Â·94); and 3Â·5, 3Â·7, and 2Â·6 per 100 child-years in groups A, B, and C, respectively (p=0Â·25)."
PMC3641608,S116,,"30 children in group A, 20 in group B, and nine in group C stopped nevirapine because of starting antituberculosis treatment."
PMC3641608,S117,,"Whereas in group A nevirapine was mainly substituted with zidovudine (<3 years) or efavirenz (>3 years), in the four-drug groups, about a third (five children in group B and six in C) simply dropped nevirapine during four-drug induction to continue on three NRTIs."
PMC3641608,S118,,"Adverse events resulted in a drug being substituted or dropped in five children in group A, 28 in group B, and 26 in group C; most changes were zidovudine-related (16 in B, 20 in C; table 2)."
PMC3641608,S119,,Adherence by self-reported questionnaire was similar in both monitoring groups: mean 6Â·7% (1813/26â€ˆ917) of children on clinically driven monitoring reported missing doses in the past 28 days versus 6Â·5% (1683/25â€ˆ935) on routine laboratory monitoring (p=0Â·26).

PMC3641608,S197,,Discussion
PMC3641608,S198,,The DART trial5 in African adults with HIV showed that routine laboratory monitoring for ART side-effects had no effect on toxicity outcomes.
PMC3641608,S199,,"Although routine CD4 monitoring had significant benefits on disease progression and mortality, absolute differences were small.5"
PMC3641608,S200,,Health-economic analyses suggested point-of-care CD4 tests would need to cost less than US$3Â·80 for monitoring every 12 weeks after the first year on ART to be cost-effective.25
PMC3641608,S201,,"Smaller adult trials of routine CD4 or viral load monitoring, or both, have shown similar results,6â€“8 although no other trial has investigated toxicity monitoring."
PMC3641608,S202,,"These results provide strong reassurance that increasing coverage by rollout of ART to adults at lower-level health facilities is the most rational and cost-effective policy at a population level, irrespective of provision of laboratory monitoring."
PMC3641608,S203,,Most health centres in resource-limited settings treat adults and children with HIV in the same clinics.
PMC3641608,S204,,"However, results from studies in adults might not generalise to children who have different comorbidities (eg, more anaemia associated with malnutrition, malaria, and sepsis, which could affect haematological monitoring)."
PMC3641608,S205,,"Differences in predictive value and interpretation of CD4 tests,9,10 faster disease progression in young children,26 and greater sensitivity of ART-related weight gain (which has reflected virological response27) could also affect the relative benefits of laboratory versus clinical monitoring."
PMC3641608,S206,,Panel
PMC3641608,S207,,Research in context
PMC3641608,S208,,Systematic review
PMC3641608,S209,,"We searched PubMed up to Jan 5, 2013, with search terms â€œHIVâ€ù AND â€œmonitoringâ€ù AND (â€œantiretroviral therapyâ€ù OR â€œARTâ€ù) AND â€œtrialâ€ù*."
PMC3641608,S210,,"We identified three trials in adults;5,7,8 one further trial had been presented but not published.6"
PMC3641608,S211,,There were no trials in children.
PMC3641608,S212,,"Trials in adults showed that clinical monitoring was safe and feasible, but CD4 monitoring to detect first-line failure provided small additional benefits; addition of viral load to routine CD4 monitoring provided no further benefits."
PMC3641608,S213,,"Replacement of â€œmonitoringâ€ù with child* identified previous short-term (24 or 48 week) trials that showed three-drug protease inhibitor-based (lopinavir or ritonavir) ART to be superior to nevirapine-based ART in children younger than 3 years;28,29 however, studies in older children found similar responses,30 and lopinavir and ritonavir are costly and logistically challenging to administer."
PMC3641608,S214,,Interpretation
PMC3641608,S215,,"Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; abacavir or zidovudine plus lamivudine) is not needed in children, as in adults; requiring such monitoring might be a barrier to life-saving treatment."
PMC3641608,S216,,"CD4 monitoring provided a small but significant reduction in disease progression or death after the second year on ART in children, as in adults."
PMC3641608,S217,,"However, unlike adults, CD4 and viral load responses were very similar irrespective of CD4 versus clinical monitoring."
PMC3641608,S218,,"Monitoring weight-gain appeared a sensitive indicator of first-line CD4 failure, and drug changes occurred as often for concurrent tuberculosis as for adverse events."
PMC3641608,S219,,"Four-drug ART with an NNRTI plus three NRTIs provided superior short-term virological suppression and CD4 responses, but these benefits were not sustained during maintenance three-drug ART."
PMC3641608,S220,,"However, 83% of children in ARROW had viral load less than 400 copies per mL with abacavir, lamivudine, and a NNRTI for 3Â·7 years, irrespective of age, supporting previously reported superiority of abacavir over zidovudine.23"
PMC3641608,S221,,"Three-NRTI long-term maintenance was clinically and immunologically similar to NNRTI-based ART, and would be useful during tuberculosis cotreatment."
PMC3641608,S222,,Results support an integrated approach to treatment of adults and children in treatment rollout.
PMC3641608,S223,,"Cost and feasibility (eg, through point-of-care tests) of provision of CD4 monitoring are future challenges."
PMC3641608,S224,,We therefore undertook the first paediatric trial investigating ART monitoring in children with fairly advanced HIV disease (panel).
PMC3641608,S225,,"We found that NNRTI-based regimens, including WHO-recommended NRTIs, can be delivered safely across childhood without routine toxicity monitoring."
PMC3641608,S226,,"Toxicity substitutions were infrequent, as previously reported;31 most were because of asymptomatic haematology results in children on zidovudine."
PMC3641608,S227,,"Interestingly, grade 3 and 4 and grade 4 anaemias occurred similarly across groups receiving and not receiving zidovudine, both short and long term, suggesting that anaemia in children on ART is most likely caused by chronic HIV infection rather than antiretroviral drugs."
PMC3641608,S228,,"Therefore, routine haemoglobin monitoring is likely unnecessary, even in children on zidovudine, and continuation of zidovudine without substitution (as occurred in clinically driven monitoring group C children) is unlikely to result in harm."
PMC3641608,S229,,"Further, lack of haemoglobin testing before initiation of ART should not prevent zidovudine use, since haemoglobin values increased after ART initiation."
PMC3641608,S230,,"Crucially, we observed no evidence of interaction between monitoring and ART strategies on any toxicity outcome."
PMC3641608,S231,,We previously reported very few possible hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir (four [<1%] in 1206 patients32) or difficulties managing abacavir plus nevirapine together in African children.
PMC3641608,S232,,"Importantly for programme planners, first-line drug substitutions occurred as often for tuberculosis as for adverse events."
PMC3641608,S233,,Tuberculosis was also by far the most common WHO stage 3 or 4 event.
PMC3641608,S234,,One advantage of the four-drug induction regimen was the ability to simply drop nevirapine in children starting rifampicin.
PMC3641608,S235,,"The ongoing tuberculosis incidence illustrates the potential usefulness of three-NRTI regimens in children, with 91% randomly assigned to group C still receiving maintenance with lamivudine, abacavir, and zidovudine after median 4 years."
PMC3641608,S236,,"Tuberculosis remains particularly difficult to manage in children younger than 3 years who cannot take efavirenz, because rifampicin coadministration significantly reduces nevirapine33 and lopinavir concentrations."
PMC3641608,S237,,"Super-boosting with additional ritonavir has been recommended with lopinavir,34 but ritonavir is unpalatable and difficult to dose.15"
PMC3641608,S238,,"Substitution to three NRTIs is frequently used for children on NNRTI plus two NRTIs developing tuberculosis, but there have been concerns about reduced efficacy."
PMC3641608,S239,,Viral load suppression was similar to standard NNRTI-based ART at 48 weeks for children moving to maintenance three-NRTI at 36 weeks.
PMC3641608,S240,,"However, viral load suppression was significantly lower at 144 weeks, suggesting that long-term three-NRTI treatment would not be advisable (even after four-drug induction)."
PMC3641608,S241,,"Importantly, there was no evidence of immunological or clinical harm from roughly 15% lower viral load suppression long-term with three NRTIs; if anything this group had fewer clinical events, similar to previous randomised adult data.35"
PMC3641608,S242,,These findings provide reassurance that a three-NRTI regimen is safe for children on ART when they need antituberculosis co-treatment.
PMC3641608,S243,,"Overall, there was no evidence that clinically driven monitoring was inferior to routine laboratory monitoring in terms of disease progression or mortality."
PMC3641608,S244,,"However, we found interactions with time on ART, disease progression or death being somewhat lower in the clinically driven monitoring group in the first year."
PMC3641608,S245,,"Chance seems the most likely explanation, because management was similar with no child switching to second-line during the first year in both groups."
PMC3641608,S246,,"The only other possible explanation is that receiving CD4, biochemistry, and haematology results was actually harmful for children (eg, resulting in clinicians failing to undertake proper clinical evaluations), which seems implausible."
PMC3641608,S247,,"From the second year, our results are qualitatively similar to those of the DART trial, with small but significant clinical event excesses in clinically driven monitoring."
PMC3641608,S248,,"However, event rates were substantially lower than in DART, so the excess remained within the non-inferiority margin; also fewer children switched to second-line ART with similar proportions in both groups."
PMC3641608,S249,,"Unlike DART, there was no evidence of excess switching with very low CD4 in clinically driven monitoring."
PMC3641608,S250,,"Whereas switches in routine laboratory monitoring were predominantly triggered by falling CD4, in clinically driven monitoring most switches were for failure to thrive, which might be a more sensitive indicator of first-line CD4 failure than in adults and could be used where CD4 monitoring is unavailable."
PMC3641608,S251,,"Unnecessary switching at high CD4 did occur, as in DART, but in very few children (six on clinically driven monitoring and none on routine monitoring switched with CD4 greater than 25%)."
PMC3641608,S252,,"Other paediatric studies in which routine CD4 and viral load monitoring were used have also reported fairly low rates of switching from first-line NNRTI-based ART over 5â€“6 years (eg, 8% of 2570 Ugandan children;36 22% in the PENPACT-1 trial30)."
PMC3641608,S253,,"As expected and previously reported, most deaths were soon after starting ART in children with lowest pre-ART CD4 or weight for age.37"
PMC3641608,S254,,"Irrespective of monitoring strategy, 5-year survival was remarkably high (96%, compared with 88% in DART), emphasising the importance of good clinical care, and availability of continuous ART and concomitant treatments."
PMC3641608,S255,,"Loss to follow-up was only 2Â·7%, providing confidence that results are robust."
PMC3641608,S256,,We also observed no differences between clinically driven and routine laboratory monitoring in CD4 or viral load responses.
PMC3641608,S257,,"The only difference between monitoring strategies was in serious adverse events, due to an excess of clinical malaria admissions to hospital in clinically driven monitoring."
PMC3641608,S258,,"One limitation is that the trial allocation was of necessity open; lack of knowledge of CD4 in a child on clinically driven monitoring presenting with fever could have influenced decisions about hospital admission, given the plausible differential diagnosis of bacteraemia.38"
PMC3641608,S259,,"Data for viral load from the 78% of children with results suggest that initiation of ART with four drugs might significantly improve early viral load suppression, consistent with greater early CD4 responses, particularly in those with very low pre-ART CD4."
PMC3641608,S260,,"By design all children moved to three drugs at 36 weeks, in view of the possible toxicity and costs of four-drug regimens in the long term."
PMC3641608,S261,,"Since toxicity differences were restricted to asymptomatic laboratory results with no effect on ART management, results hint that a longer-term four-drug, three NRTIs plus one NNRTI regimen might have continued to provide viral load and CD4 benefits, although this might not have translated into clinical benefit."
PMC3641608,S262,,"However, viral load suppression with two NRTIs plus an NNRTI was fairly high, with 83% of children receiving an NNRTI with abacavir plus lamivudine throughout achieving less than 400 copies per mL long term, irrespective of monitoring strategy, so further gains from a fourth drug might be less plausible."
PMC3641608,S263,,"Viral load suppression was similar to other trials in which viral load monitoring was done routinely (eg, 82% <400 copies per mL after median 5 years on two NRTIs plus an NNRTI or a protease inhibitor;30 85% of infants <400 copies per mL after median 5 years on two NRTI plsu lopinavir or ritonavir (A Violari, personal communication); 85% and 75% of children <3 years <400 copies per mL after 48 weeks on two NRTI plus lopinavir or ritonavir, or nevirapine, respectively28)."
PMC3641608,S264,,"This finding might be partly because of superiority of abacavir (in the ARROW two-NRTI backbone) over zidovudine, as previously reported.27"
PMC3641608,S265,,"Coupled with the low clinical event rates after 1 year in ARROW, our data suggest any additional benefits from routine viral load monitoring are likely to be small."
PMC3641608,S266,,"Although CD4 and viral load failure do not correlate well,39 the implications of late detection of viral load failure are likely to depend largely on how resistance evolves with persisting viral replication."
PMC3641608,S267,,"In PENPACT-1, lamivudine and NNRTI resistance occurred with low-level viral load failure,30 so the consequences of delaying switch on these regimens until CD4 failure might be small; the 3-year PHPT trial in adults, which randomly assigned patients to routine CD4 with or without viral load monitoring, found no additional benefit from viral load, although patients in both groups of this trial had high viral load suppression.6"
PMC3641608,S268,,"Although open allocation was an unavoidable limitation of the monitoring randomisation and was not undertaken for the ART-strategy randomisation, the endpoint review committee adjudicated endpoints masked to randomisation."
PMC3641608,S269,,"In a survey at ARROW exit, only four (1%) of 561 participants on clinically driven monitoring reported having CD4 testing done privately; clinicians remained masked."
PMC3641608,S270,,"One possible criticism is that all ARROW centres had laboratories; however, the only way our results would not generalise to centres with lower-quality clinical care would be if these health-care workers were able to act more appropriately on routine laboratory results than in centres with high-quality care."
PMC3641608,S271,,This scenario seems unlikely since substantial CD4 variability and complexity around toxicity test interpretation mean that simple rules for acting on routine test results are unlikely ever to be optimum.
PMC3641608,S272,,"Rather, clinicians providing the best clinical care are plausibly also best able to interpret and act on routine laboratory results."
PMC3641608,S273,,"Thus although the overall risks of WHO events or death might be higher under poorer clinical care, differences in outcomes between routine and clinically driven laboratory monitoring would be likely, if anything, to be even smaller than observed in ARROW."
PMC3641608,S274,,"Of note, we found no evidence that small benefits from CD4 monitoring varied by pre-ART CD4 or percentage, suggesting our results are robust to changes in ART initiation thresholds."
PMC3641608,S275,,Toxicity monitoring has no benefit and costs money; it cannot therefore be cost-effective.
PMC3641608,S276,,"This fact should reinforce WHO guidelines that routine toxicity tests are not required for paediatric ART provision, as for adults."
PMC3641608,S277,,"Formal cost-effectiveness analysis is ongoing: given reduced efficacy of CD4 monitoring compared with DART, CD4 monitoring every 12 weeks is unlikely to be cost-effective in children overall (P Revill, personal communication), although it might have some potential to pick up earlier failure in older children or adolescents concealing adherence challenges."
PMC3641608,S278,,"Cost-effectiveness analysis and systematic review is also planned to compare the induction-maintenance ART strategy with NNRTI and protease inhibitor-based first-line ART, including sensitivity analyses to account for increased efficacy but greater cost of abacavir versus zidovudine."
PMC3641608,S279,,"In conclusion, ARROW results should send a strong message to African ART programmes to accelerate ART rollout to children since this process currently lags woefully behind adults.3"
PMC3641608,S280,,The key finding is that ART provides enormous benefits to children and can be delivered safely with good-quality clinical care and without routine toxicity monitoring.
PMC3641608,S281,,"For children initiating ART with severe immune suppression, addition of a fourth drug improves short-term immunological and virological responses; whether continuing a four-drug regimen longer-term would be advantageous remains unclear."
PMC3641608,S282,,"However, ARROW results support short-term use of three-drug NRTI regimens during antituberculosis treatment in children already on ART."
PMC3641608,S283,,"Simple point-of-care CD4 tests might have a future role, at least to confirm clinical need to switch to second-line ART, as in DART.40"
PMC3641608,S284,,"In children, monitoring of weight gain should be emphasised as an important additional clinical aid for identification of first-line failure."
PMC3641608,S285,,Laboratory tests remain important for assessment of ART eligibility and for diagnosis and management of intercurrent infections.
PMC3641608,S286,,Mentoring of health-care workers to foster quality clinical care and reassurance that children do very well without laboratory monitoring of ART should energise faster and further scale-up of ART rollout for children with HIV in Africa.

PMC3668094,S20,,Introduction
PMC3668094,S21,,Human influenza is often considered an acute self limiting febrile illness.
PMC3668094,S22,,"Occasionally, however, it is associated with respiratory complications, admission to hospital, and mortality.1 2 3"
PMC3668094,S23,,Clinical trials have shown that treatment with oseltamivir has clinical and virological benefit in patients with uncomplicated influenza when it is administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms.4 5 6 7
PMC3668094,S24,,"Randomised trials in patients with severe influenza are lacking, but observational studies in patients admitted to hospital indicate that oseltamivir treatment, especially if it is given early, is associated with reduced mortality and shorter length of stay, although mortality can still be up to 6% with H1N1-pdm09 (pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza) or seasonal influenza.8 9 10 11 12"
PMC3668094,S25,,"Timely oseltamivir treatment of patients with avian H5N1 influenza reduces mortality, but many patients die despite treatment."
PMC3668094,S26,,"Higher oseltamivir doses were tested in patients with uncomplicated influenza, but no consistently improved clinical or virological outcomes were found compared with the standard dose.4 5 13 14"
PMC3668094,S27,,"Despite a lack of evidence, several authorities have suggested use of double dose oseltamivir for severe influenza.15 16 17"
PMC3668094,S28,,"The use of higher doses has major implications for clinical management, public health, and planning for antiviral stockpiles."
PMC3668094,S29,,"The sudden emergence of pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, the persistent circulation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses across large regions of the world since 1997, and the recent emergence and spread of avian H7N9 influenza virus in China18 illustrate the continuing threat of influenza viruses to global health."
PMC3668094,S30,,Improvement of the evidence base for current treatment guidelines of severe influenza is clearly essential for optimal clinical management and pandemic preparedness.
PMC3668094,S31,,"Consequently, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to ascertain whether double dose oseltamivir controls viral replication faster and improves clinical outcomes compared with standard dose in patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza."

PMC3668094,S96,,A further 13 (3.9%) were positive by rapid antigen test but negative by RT-PCR.
PMC3668094,S97,,The latter were confirmed as false positive tests as there was no rise in haemagglutination inhibition titers during convalescence.
PMC3668094,S98,,All patients with H5N1 met criteria for severe influenza and were therefore analysed as such.
PMC3668094,S99,,Patients were enrolled a median of 5 (range 1-10) days after the onset of illness: 7 (3-11) days for patients with H5N1 infected and 5 (1-10) days in other patients (P<0.001).

PMC3668094,S163,,In this large randomised controlled trial of antiviral treatment in patients with severe influenza we found that double dose oseltamivir was well tolerated but did not confer additional virological or clinical benefits over standard dose treatment in patients in South East Asia.
PMC3668094,S164,,"There were no differences between the treatment arms in detection of viral RNA or infectious virus on day five, and there were also no differences in clinical failure rates, mortality in hospital, or rates of adverse events between the dose regimens on day five."
PMC3668094,S165,,We enrolled a heterogeneous population that included mostly children and also those infected with avian H5N1 or H1N1-pdm09 viruses.
PMC3668094,S166,,"While subgroup analyses based on age cohorts, virus type and subtype, and time to treatment did not suggest additional virological efficacy of double dose oseltamivir in any subgroup, these results should be interpreted with caution as the study was not powered for these analyses."
PMC3668094,S167,,"Our patients presented relatively late after the onset of illness, a median of five days overall (seven days for H5N1)."
PMC3668094,S168,,"Despite administration of oseltamivir, about 30% of those enrolled remained positive for viral RNA (the primary endpoint) after five days of treatment."
PMC3668094,S169,,Timing of oseltamivir treatment is important as several studies have shown that early treatment confers greater virological and clinical benefits.4 5 6 32 33 34
PMC3668094,S170,,"In particular, later viral clearance has been noted with delayed treatment with oseltamivir compared with treatment within two to three days after onset of symptoms in observational reports from patients with H1N1-pdm09, especially those with severe illness.35 36 37 38 39 40"
PMC3668094,S171,,"In the current trial, 73 (22.4%) patients presented within three days of illness, but even in this subpopulation, double dose oseltamivir was not associated with more rapid viral RNA clearance."
PMC3668094,S172,,"Over a quarter of patients received neuraminidase inhibitors before enrolment, which could have influenced the effect size and contributed to the low proportion of patients shedding virus at day five in both treatment groups."
PMC3668094,S173,,"Although viral RNA detection in samples from the upper respiratory tract might not accurately reflect viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, especially in those with severe illness,39 prolonged viral RNA detection in upper respiratory tract samples has been shown to correlate with inpatient morbidity and prolonged hospital stay."
PMC3668094,S174,,"In our study viral detection on day five was observed at about twofold the frequency in those meeting the criteria for clinical failure, although lack of clinical failure was not a surrogate for cessation of viral detection."
PMC3668094,S175,,"Thus in our study the delays in starting treatment with oseltamivir also probably contributed to the substantial rates of admission to intensive care (18%), use of supplemental oxygen (30%), mechanical ventilation (12%), and mortality in hospital of 6.4%."
PMC3668094,S176,,"Although our study was not placebo controlled for ethical reasons, other studies indicate that early oseltamivir treatment in people with severe influenza is associated with both clinical benefits and more rapid viral clearance from upper respiratory tract samples.4 8 14 36 37 38 39 40 41"
PMC3668094,S177,,Possible reasons for findings
PMC3668094,S178,,It is unclear why double dose oseltamivir does not seem to offer benefit over standard dose in patients with severe influenza.
PMC3668094,S179,,Blood trough concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate from 75 mg or 150 mg twice daily in influenza exceed the IC50 (inhibitory concentration) of influenza viruses.42 43
PMC3668094,S180,,"Inhibition of viral neuraminidase by oseltamivir might be a saturable process, and maximal inhibition might be achieved with a standard dose; exceeding these concentrations might not produce an additional clinical or virological effect."
PMC3668094,S181,,"In this regard, a randomised oseltamivir controlled study of intravenous peramivir (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC), which reaches over 20-fold higher peak blood concentrations of active metabolite than oseltamivir carboxylate, found similar viral reductions in patients with influenza A virus admitted to hospital.44"
PMC3668094,S182,,Further studies of peramivir and other intravenous neuraminidase inhibitors currently in progress should provide additional evidence regarding this hypothesis.
PMC3668094,S183,,"Infection with avian H5N1 virus, higher baseline viral load, and severity of disease were independently associated with longer viral RNA detection."
PMC3668094,S184,,"The association between avian H5N1, severe illness, and prolonged shedding has been well described.14"
PMC3668094,S185,,"The clearance kinetics of influenza viruses, both without antiviral treatment and with oseltamivir treatment,32 41 could explain longer viral RNA detection with higher baseline viral loads."
PMC3668094,S186,,It is unclear whether the independent association with disease severity might be related to impaired mechanisms of viral clearance or higher intrinsic rates of viral replication or both in these patients.
PMC3668094,S187,,Severe chronic comorbidities are seen commonly in industrialised countries and are related to prolonged viral shedding but most of our patients lacked these comorbidities.40 41
PMC3668094,S188,,"The heterogeneous population characteristics, geographical differences in recruitment (most patients were from Vietnam but there were no significant differences between Vietnam and other sites), and the variety of infecting viruses in our trial reflect the clinical circumstances in South East Asia during our study but might be viewed as a limitation."
PMC3668094,S189,,"Most of these patients were children and had low or normal BMI, and for all patients only about a fifth reported a chronic underlying medical condition."
PMC3668094,S190,,"Thus, our findings are applicable primarily to the region where the study was conducted and other settings with similar characteristics of influenza epidemiology."
PMC3668094,S191,,We did not have many adults in our study and results were inconclusive but indicate no difference in efficacy between the two oseltamivir regimens.
PMC3668094,S192,,"We would caution the extension of our results to, for example, morbidly obese adults with severe influenza and those who could have underlying chronic illnesses."
PMC3668094,S193,,We conducted several statistical comparisons and inevitably subgroup analyses involved small numbers; thus power was limited and some significant results could have resulted by chance.
PMC3668094,S194,,"Additionally, as all patients were randomised to an active treatment, our study was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of oseltamivir in severe influenza nor in H5N1 infections."
PMC3668094,S195,,"This large randomised trial did, however, examine an important clinical and public health question and showed a lack of a clinical or virological benefit of double dose compared with standard dose oseltamivir in patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza."
PMC3668094,S196,,Our results and other observational reports from avian H5N110 and H1N1-pdm0911 36 infections do not support routine use of double dose oseltamivir to treat severe influenza.
PMC3668094,S197,,These findings have implications for both clinical management and pandemic preparedness including during the current H7N9 epidemic.16 17 18
PMC3668094,S198,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3668094,S199,,Clinical trials in patients with uncomplicated influenza have shown that treatment with oseltamivir has clinical and virological benefit when administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms
PMC3668094,S200,,"Observational studies in severe influenza have shown that oseltamivir treatment, if given early, is associated with reduced mortality and shorter length of hospital stay."
PMC3668094,S201,,Reduced mortality has also been reported for patients with H5N1 influenza treated with oseltamivir
PMC3668094,S202,,"Several authorities have suggested the use of double dose oseltamivir for severe influenza, although there is no clinical evidence to support this"
PMC3668094,S203,,What this study adds
PMC3668094,S204,,"In the largest randomised trial on the treatment of severe influenza, no clinical or virological benefit of double dose oseltamivir over standard dose was found"
PMC3668094,S205,,These findings have implications for both clinical management of severe influenza and for pandemic preparedness of emerging influenza viruses including the current H7N9 epidemic

PMC3686261,S2,,Association of joint space narrowing with impairment of physical function and work ability in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: protection beyond disease control by adalimumab plus methotrexate
PMC3686261,S3,,Abstract
PMC3686261,S4,,Objectives
PMC3686261,S5,,Tumour necrosis factor inhibition plus methotrexate is believed to inhibit radiographic progression independent of inflammation.
PMC3686261,S6,,"This analysis assessed whether these protective effects are exerted on bone (joint erosion; JE) and/or cartilage (joint space narrowing; JSN), and what the independent effects of JE/JSN progression are on longer-term patient-reported outcomes."
PMC3686261,S7,,Methods
PMC3686261,S8,,"PREMIER was a 2-year, randomised, controlled trial of adalimumab plus methotrexate (ADA+MTX) versus the monotherapies."
PMC3686261,S9,,The impact of treatment on the relationships between time-averaged disease activity (TA-DAS28(CRP)) and changes in JE/JSN and associations of JE/JSN with the disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) at baseline and weeks 52 and 104 were assessed through non-parametric approaches of analysis of variance and quantile regression.
PMC3686261,S10,,JE/JSN association with employment status was evaluated at baseline and weeks 52 and 104 through logistic regression.
PMC3686261,S11,,Results
PMC3686261,S12,,"Increasing tertiles of TA-DAS28(CRP) were associated with JE and JSN progression in the monotherapy groups, a phenomenon largely absent in ADA+MTX-treated patients."
PMC3686261,S13,,"Although JSN was not associated with HAQ-DI at baseline, it was at 52 and 104â€…weeks."
PMC3686261,S14,,"In contrast, JE was not associated with HAQ-DI at any time point examined."
PMC3686261,S15,,"Odds of being employed at baseline, 52â€…weeks and 104â€…weeks were significantly associated with lower JSN, but not JE, scores."
PMC3686261,S16,,Conclusions
PMC3686261,S17,,ADA+MTX inhibited both JE and JSN progression independently of disease activity.
PMC3686261,S18,,JSN played a more prominent role in patient-reported outcomes than JE.
PMC3686261,S19,,Preventing the onset or worsening of JSN probably represents a critical aspect of effective disease management of early rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PMC3686261,S20,,Introduction
PMC3686261,S21,,"In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), both inflammation and joint damage can result in loss of physical function.1 2"
PMC3686261,S22,,"Although the portion of physical disability that is associated with inflammation is generally reversible, the component associated with joint damage is thought to be largely permanent.3"
PMC3686261,S23,,"Given the tight correlation between physical disability and loss of social and economic opportunities in patients with RA,4 treatment options capable of profoundly interfering with joint damage and inflammation would appear to be of greater individual and societal value."
PMC3686261,S24,,The combination of a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor and methotrexate reduces the risk of joint damage onset or progression and improves physical function more effectively than methotrexate alone.5â€“10
PMC3686261,S25,,These benefits are thought to result partly from a more rapid and intense inhibition of inflammation with combination therapy than with methotrexate alone.
PMC3686261,S26,,"However, patients treated with combination therapy tend to have minimal or no progression of joint damage regardless of inflammatory activity; whereas the level of joint damage tends to reflect the extent of inflammation in methotrexate-treated patients,11â€“15 suggesting that combination therapy may inhibit joint damage through mechanisms that are independent of inflammatory activity."
PMC3686261,S27,,"Alternatively, the TNF cytokine may cause joint damage only after it exceeds some threshold that is greater than that required to cause inflammation.16"
PMC3686261,S28,,"Joint damage results from the destruction of bone and cartilage, which can be visualised through radiography as joint erosion (JE) and joint space narrowing (JSN), respectively."
PMC3686261,S29,,"While JSN is a surrogate marker for loss of cartilage, it may also reflect damage to other (soft) tissues causing joint dislocation, a phenomenon that is less prevalent among patients with early RA."
PMC3686261,S30,,"Although JE historically has been perceived to be the most critical indicator of permanent disability in RA patients, recent data suggest that, early in the disease process, JSN may be the more important predictor of irreversible physical disability, as measured by the residual score on the disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) in patients whose disease is in remission.17 18"
PMC3686261,S31,,"In the present analysis, we evaluated the joint-protective effects of three different therapies, the combination of adalimumab plus methotrexate (ADA+MTX), adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy, on JE and JSN as a function of inflammatory activity, using data from a randomised, controlled trial of methotrexate-naive patients with early RA.9"

PMC3686261,S110,,"Treatment with the combination of a TNF inhibitor and methotrexate often limits, or even prevents, joint damage in patients who may lack an otherwise measurable clinical response.11â€“15"
PMC3686261,S111,,Our results further refine the understanding of this clinical and functional benefit by demonstrating that ADA+MTX protects against JE and JSN onset or worsening; both of these benefits are also largely independent of the therapeutic effect on inflammatory activity.
PMC3686261,S112,,Earlier analyses have not evaluated the individual effects of anti-TNF plus methotrexate on JE and JSN progression in response to disease activity.11â€“15
PMC3686261,S113,,These findings reveal that both JE and JSN increase consistently with increasing disease activity in patients treated with methotrexate monotherapy.
PMC3686261,S114,,"Interestingly, a similar trend in JE and JSN increase in relation to disease activity is seen with adalimumab monotherapy."
PMC3686261,S115,,"However, a recent analysis suggests that adalimumab provides better joint protection than methotrexate in individual joints with pre-existing damage, irrespective of the presence of synovitis.29"
PMC3686261,S116,,"Importantly, ADA+MTX reduces the progression of both JE and JSN in a manner that is independent of disease activity."
PMC3686261,S117,,"Interestingly, the relationship between disease activity and JSN progression appeared less prevalent than with JE progression, suggesting that ADA+MTX may have even stronger inhibitory effects on JSN progression than on JE progression, despite persistent inflammation."
PMC3686261,S118,,"Alternatively, the threshold of TNF required to elicit JSN may be higher than that required to cause erosive damage."
PMC3686261,S119,,This novel finding on the abrogation of effects of disease activity on JSN by combination therapy with ADA+MTX appears to be of particular importance in light of recent observations that JSN may affect physical function more profoundly than bony joint damage.17
PMC3686261,S120,,"Indeed, the present analysis expands these findings by demonstrating that in early RA patients progression of JSN, but not JE, is not only significantly associated with loss of physical function, but that JSN progression also has an adverse effect on employment status not seen with JE progression, even at this early stage of disease."
PMC3686261,S121,,A positive association between physical function and joint damage has been documented in advanced RA.27 28 30
PMC3686261,S122,,"Less consideration has been given to this relationship in early RA patients, although increasing joint damage and longer disease duration have been linked to irreversible physical disability.3"
PMC3686261,S123,,"In a study of patients with advanced RA, joint damage was associated with HAQ-DI after adjustment for age, sex, DAS28, CRP, disease duration and treatment type.28"
PMC3686261,S124,,A similar set of covariates was evaluated in this analysis.
PMC3686261,S125,,"No relationship between JSN and HAQ-DI was apparent at baseline; however, JSN and HAQ-DI were associated following both 52 and 104â€…weeks of treatment."
PMC3686261,S126,,"It is possible that baseline disease activity masked the relationship between JSN and HAQ-DI, and this relationship only became discernible once treatment reduced disease activity sufficiently."
PMC3686261,S127,,"Alternatively, the inability to detect this relationship at baseline may have reflected the short duration of disease in these patients, as an impact on physical function may require a threshold of accrued damage not yet achieved at baseline."
PMC3686261,S128,,"In addition, an earlier analysis from PREMIER identified no relationship between concurrent values of the mTSS and HAQ-DI, but a change in the mTSS was significantly associated with HAQ-DI,31 suggesting that progression of joint damage may be more predictive of future function than existing damage in early RA."
PMC3686261,S129,,The consistency of the relationships reported across the evaluated 2-year period suggests that these results may be extrapolated to patients with a longer duration of disease than those included in this study.
PMC3686261,S130,,"Indeed, the observed coefficients, although indicative of a weak association, are consistent with those obtained from longitudinal analyses of patients with more advanced disease.28 30"
PMC3686261,S131,,"They also indicate that subtle progression of JSN in patients with aggressive forms of the disease, if left unchecked, may lead to long-term disability.17"
PMC3686261,S132,,"Although previous results are suggestive of an interconnected association between joint damage, physical function and employment status,19 32 33 the relative contribution of JE and JSN progression to employment status has not yet been evaluated."
PMC3686261,S133,,Our data indicate that progression of JSN plays a more prominent role than JE in determining employment status.
PMC3686261,S134,,"Patients with RA frequently lose their jobs early in the course of the disease, with 20âˆ’30% experiencing permanent work disability during the first 2âˆ’3â€…years after diagnosis.34"
PMC3686261,S135,,These data indicate that early control of JSN progression is important not only to protect patientsâ€™ physical functioning but to help them maintain the lifestyle they had before RA diagnosis.
PMC3686261,S136,,"A similar association with reduced physical function and job impairment is observed in patients with osteoarthritis;35 however, there is no evidence that existing osteoarthritis independently impacted JE or JSN progression or HAQ-DI scores in this database."
PMC3686261,S137,,Several limitations must temper the interpretation of the results of this study.
PMC3686261,S138,,"Although the radiographic endpoints used are widely reported and validated, they remain surrogate measures that rely on visual representation and interpretation of joint damage and can be subject to error and bias."
PMC3686261,S139,,"Furthermore, as JSN is not a direct measure of cartilage damage, surrounding tissues may also be damaged, and the JSN measurement technique cannot determine the relative contributions of these tissues."
PMC3686261,S140,,"Still, such contribution is less likely at this early stage of disease."
PMC3686261,S141,,The joints analysed for JE and JSN also offer limitations.
PMC3686261,S142,,"Larger joints, such as joints of the knee, may impact physical function and employability to a greater extent than the joints of the hands, wrist and feet that are scored for JE and JSN, and an examination into grip strength in relation to these patient-reported outcomes may have produced greater correlations."
PMC3686261,S143,,"However, it is important to note that this study included patients with an average disease duration of less than 1â€…year; therefore, finding a statistically significant association between these variables at this early stage of RA portends a high risk of a much larger consequence if damage were allowed to accrue over longer periods."
PMC3686261,S144,,Differences in patient discontinuations over time represent a further limitation.
PMC3686261,S145,,"Still, the observed differences between treatment groups may have been more pronounced had rates of discontinuation been comparable across treatment groups."
PMC3686261,S146,,"Finally, the post-hoc nature of these analyses should be considered to be hypothesis generating and require confirmation in other databases of patients with early RA."
PMC3686261,S147,,Conclusions
PMC3686261,S148,,"In this population with early, progressive RA, JSN progression was associated with impairment in physical function and work status throughout 2â€…years of treatment, but JE progression was not."
PMC3686261,S149,,"Because of the clinical implications of JSN progression for disability and work impairment, protection from the onset or worsening of JSN should be an important factor when choosing between therapeutic modalities."
PMC3686261,S150,,Combination therapy with ADA+MTX suppresses JE and JSN progression and does so in a manner independent of clinical disease activity.

PMC3756454,S3,,Abstract
PMC3756454,S4,,Objective
PMC3756454,S5,,"The inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), exerts deleterious cardiovascular effects."
PMC3756454,S6,,We wished to determine the effects of TNF-Î± antagonism on endothelial function and platelet activation in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
PMC3756454,S7,,Design and setting and patients
PMC3756454,S8,,"A double-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial performed in a tertiary referral cardiac centre."
PMC3756454,S9,,26 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction randomised to receive an intravenous infusion of etanercept (10â€…mg) or saline placebo.
PMC3756454,S10,,Main outcome measures
PMC3756454,S11,,"Leucocyte count, plasma cytokine concentrations, flow cytometric measures of platelet activation and peripheral vasomotor and fibrinolytic function were determined before and 24â€…h after study intervention."
PMC3756454,S12,,Results
PMC3756454,S13,,"Consistent with effective conjugation of circulating TNF-Î±, plasma TNF-Î± concentrations increased in all patients following etanercept (254Â±15 vs 0.12Â±0.02 pg/ml; p<0.0001), but not saline infusion."
PMC3756454,S14,,Etanercept treatment reduced neutrophil (7.4Â±0.6 vs 8.8Â±0.6Ã—109 cells/l; p=0.03) and plasma interleukin-6 concentrations (5.8Â±2.0 vs 10.6Â±4.0â€…pg/ml; p=0.012) at 24â€…h but increased plateletâ€“monocyte aggregation (30Â±5 vs 20Â±3%; p=0.02).
PMC3756454,S15,,"Vasodilatation in response to substance P, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, and acute tissue plasminogen activator release were unaffected by either treatment (p>0.1 for all)."
PMC3756454,S16,,Conclusions
PMC3756454,S17,,"Following acute myocardial infarction, etanercept reduces systemic inflammation but increases platelet activation without affecting peripheral vasomotor or fibrinolytic function."
PMC3756454,S18,,We conclude that TNF-Î± antagonism is unlikely to be a beneficial therapeutic strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
PMC3756454,S19,,Introduction
PMC3756454,S20,,"The relationship between inflammatory disorders and atherosclerosis has been recognised for over a century, and there now exists clear evidence to support the concept that immune responses are critical in the initiation, progression and destabilisation of atherosclerosis."
PMC3756454,S21,,"T lymphocytes and monocytes are present within stable and unstable atherosclerotic plaques, and act to mediate both atherogenesis and plaque destabilisation.1"
PMC3756454,S22,,"The inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis is exemplified by the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis2 and systemic lupus erythematosis,3 independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors."
PMC3756454,S23,,"Similarly, acute inflammation, such as that occurring in the context of infections of the respiratory and urinary tract, is temporally associated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.4"
PMC3756454,S24,,"Elevated concentrations of inflammatory mediators predict the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events, even in apparently healthy low risk individuals without overt cardiovascular disease.5"
PMC3756454,S25,,"Despite the longstanding recognition of the importance of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and the precipitation of thrombotic events, anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis has received little attention."
PMC3756454,S26,,"However, targeted anti-inflammatory therapy is a highly attractive concept, particularly for the treatment of acute vascular inflammation, as this is a universal component of the development of acute coronary syndromes."
PMC3756454,S27,,"Tumour necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and T cells, and is instrumental in the mediation of vascular inflammation."
PMC3756454,S28,,"TNF-Î± receptors are expressed on all critical cellular effectors of atherogenesis, namely, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and activated leucocytes such as T lymphocytes and macrophages.6"
PMC3756454,S29,,"TNF-Î± production is deleterious to vascular homeostasis through the induction of endothelial surface adhesion molecule expression mediating plateletâ€“leucocyte interactions, cellular aggregation and thrombus formation.7"
PMC3756454,S30,,TNF-Î± production is increased in unstable atherosclerotic plaques8 and is detectable in increased concentrations in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).9
PMC3756454,S31,,"Furthermore, plasma TNF-Î± concentrations are predictive of death and recurrent ischaemic events following AMI.10"
PMC3756454,S32,,"We have previously demonstrated that TNF-Î± mediates vascular inflammation with potentially beneficial pro-fibrinolytic effects; however, it is associated with adverse inhibitory effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.11"
PMC3756454,S33,,"Consistent with these deleterious effects, antagonism of the TNF-Î± receptor has been demonstrated to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in a variety of clinical settings such as congestive cardiac failure,12 acute systemic vasculitis13 and rheumatoid arthritis.14"
PMC3756454,S34,,"The positive vascular effects of TNF-Î± antagonism may therefore be beneficial in the management of acute coronary syndromes, which are strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction."
PMC3756454,S35,,"We therefore studied the effects of the TNF-Î± receptor antagonist, etanercept, on peripheral vasomotor and fibrinolytic function, and platelet activation in patients presenting with recent AMI."

PMC3756454,S116,,Discussion
PMC3756454,S117,,This is the first study to evaluate the effect of TNF-Î± antagonism in patients with AMI.
PMC3756454,S118,,"We demonstrate that although providing a modest anti-inflammatory effect, treatment with etanercept was not associated with any improvement in peripheral vasomotor or fibrinolytic function."
PMC3756454,S119,,"Of potential concern, we identified an increase in platelet monocytes aggregation signalling a potentially adverse pro-thrombotic effect."
PMC3756454,S120,,We conclude that TNF-Î± antagonism does not appear to provide beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with AMI and is unlikely to be a beneficial novel therapy in this setting.
PMC3756454,S121,,"Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein that consists of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TNF receptor, linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1."
PMC3756454,S122,,"Etanercept inactivates circulating TNF-Î± by binding to it, thereby preventing activation of endogenous TNF-Î± receptors."
PMC3756454,S123,,"Consistent with previous reports,23 we observed a dramatic increase in plasma TNF-Î± concentrations following treatment with etanercept."
PMC3756454,S124,,"Etanercept paradoxically increases the immunoreactivity and stability of circulating TNF-Î±, probably as a consequence of its dimeric structure, which can cause an increase in the relative quantities of circulating homotrimeric, as opposed to monomeric or dimeric, TNF-Î±.24"
PMC3756454,S125,,"This paradoxical effect of TNF-Î± antagonism can lead to an effective increase in TNF-Î± mediated cytotoxicity, and this effect appears to be particularly pronounced where there is a marked molar excess of TNF-Î± relative to etanercept."
PMC3756454,S126,,"Although we did not observe any direct vascular effects associated with the increase in plasma TNF-Î± concentrations, we did observe a 50% relative increase in PMA, a measure of platelet activation."
PMC3756454,S127,,"We have previously observed an approximate 20% fall in PMA following treatment with clopidogrel,22 suggesting that the increase associated with treatment with etanercept is clinically relevant."
PMC3756454,S128,,"These findings are consistent with previous in vitro studies showing that TNF-Î± can cause an increase in platelet aggregation in patients with heart failure, probably through activation of the arachadonic acid pathway.25 26"
PMC3756454,S129,,Enhanced platelet activation through this mechanism may in part explain the thrombotic tendency associated with disorders characterised by high plasma concentrations of TNF-Î±.7
PMC3756454,S130,,"However, we did not detect a difference in P-selectin expression, an alternate measure of platelet activation."
PMC3756454,S131,,"P-selectin expression is generally very transient with low levels of expression, making this a less reliable in vivo marker of platelet activation.27"
PMC3756454,S132,,"Although this may explain our discrepant findings, we would suggest caution in interpreting the significance of our findings with PMA given that this was a single measure of platelet activation."
PMC3756454,S133,,The recognition that heart failure is characterised by high plasma concentrations of TNF-Î± has stimulated intensive research of TNF-Î± antagonism in these patients.
PMC3756454,S134,,"Interestingly, although it has been established that antagonism of TNF-Î± in the setting of congestive heart failure can ameliorate endothelial dysfunction,12 and improve left ventricular systolic dysfunction,28 several large clinical trials of TNF-Î± antagonists in patients with congestive heart failure have failed to demonstrate any clinical benefits associated with this form of treatment.29"
PMC3756454,S135,,"Furthermore, there is concern over the safety of TNF-Î± antagonism in these patients, as these trials suggest that there may be an increased risk of the development of worsening heart failure in those patients receiving higher doses of TNF-Î± antagonists.30"
PMC3756454,S136,,"The present study suggests that increased platelet activation may in part explain these observations, as any beneficial endothelial effects associated with etanercept may be offset by an increase in thrombogenicity."
PMC3756454,S137,,"Patients with coronary artery disease generally have lower plasma concentrations of TNF-Î± than patients who have progressed to develop heart failure, limiting extrapolation between these two patient populations."
PMC3756454,S138,,"We have previously demonstrated that intra-arterial TNF-Î± causes intense local vascular inflammation and a profound depression of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, associated with a compensatory increase in acute t-PA release.31"
PMC3756454,S139,,"We therefore expected that antagonism of TNF-Î± would ameliorate vascular inflammation, and lead to an improvement in vasomotor function commensurate with a fall in plasma t-PA concentrations."
PMC3756454,S140,,"Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that basal t-PA activity concentrations were diminished following etanercept."
PMC3756454,S141,,We have previously hypothesised that t-PA concentrations are increased in response to vascular inflammation as a compensatory mechanism.31
PMC3756454,S142,,The reduction in basal t-PA activity following etanercept may therefore reflect a fall in basal t-PA release through amelioration of the systemic inflammatory response associated with AMI.
PMC3756454,S143,,"However, neither PAI-1 activity nor net t-PA release in response to substance P were affected by etanercept infusion, suggesting that the magnitude of this effect was modest."
PMC3756454,S144,,"Furthermore, we saw no effect on vasomotor function."
PMC3756454,S145,,We suggest that the lack of effect on the vasomotor response may have been due to the relatively low plasma concentrations of TNF-Î± in this cohort of patients.
PMC3756454,S146,,"Although concentrations are increased in patients with AMI,8 9 patients in the present study had low plasma TNF-Î± concentrations."
PMC3756454,S147,,"The reason for this is unclear; however, it may be explained by the timing of patient recruitment into the study (on average 3â€…days following presentation) as TNF-Î± plasma concentrations are maximal within the first 24â€…h following AMI, falling off markedly thereafter, particularly in the absence of heart failure.32"

PMC3944682,S13,,"Results Mean symptom severity had minimal differences between the strategies involving no prescription and delayed prescription (recontact, post-date, collection, patient led; 1.62, 1.60, 1.82, 1.68, 1.75, respectively; likelihood ratio test Ï‡2 2.61, P=0.625)."

PMC3944682,S20,,Introduction
PMC3944682,S21,,"Acute respiratory tract infections are the commonest acute conditions managed in primary care, and the control of symptoms is a central concern of patients and parents of young patients.1 2"
PMC3944682,S22,,"Patientsâ€™ expectations and practitionersâ€™ perceptions of those expectations have helped fuel prescribing, and antibiotic use in primary care is rising progressively again after a reduction that followed a peak in the late 1990s (www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/11/eaad-resources)."
PMC3944682,S23,,"This is a key driver for antibiotic resistance,3 4 potentially leading to major infections becoming untreatable.5 6"
PMC3944682,S24,,"Delayed prescription is recommended in international guidance, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence currently recommends using a strategy of either no antibiotic prescriptions or a delayed antibiotic prescription for dealing with uncomplicated acute sore throats and other respiratory infections.7"
PMC3944682,S25,,Systematic reviews of delayed prescriptionâ€”where the patient is advised to wait for at least the expected natural history of the illness before using the prescriptionâ€”have concluded that the strategy is an effective way of reducing antibiotic use but could result in poor symptom control.8 9 10
PMC3944682,S26,,"There has also been recent debate about whether no prescription of antibiotics is better than delayed prescription, because it results in slightly lower antibiotic use.8"
PMC3944682,S27,,"Trial data for acute sore throat and chest infections have suggested that an immediate prescription and particularly delayed antibiotic prescription could reduce reconsultation compared with a no prescription strategy,11 12 but the trials were underpowered to compare strategies and detect complications."
PMC3944682,S28,,"There has also been no direct comparison of the different methods used to delay antibiotic prescription, which could have different rates of antibiotic use.8 9 10"
PMC3944682,S29,,"These methods include recontacting the clinic to request prescription by phone (recontact), post-dating the prescription (post-date), allowing patients to collect the prescription from the clinic themselves (collection), and giving prescriptions to patients and asking them to wait (patient led)."

PMC3944682,S94,,Analysis
PMC3944682,S102,,Results
PMC3944682,S103,,A total of 889 patients were recruited between 3 March 2010 and 28 March 2012 by 53 health professionals in 25 practices.
PMC3944682,S104,,"Of these patients, 333 (37%) were prescribed immediate antibiotics and 556 (63%) entered the randomised trial."
PMC3944682,S105,,Those prescribed immediate antibiotics had slightly more severe symptoms at baseline and were more likely to be labelled as having lower respiratory tract infections and less likely to be labelled as having upper respiratory tract infections.
PMC3944682,S106,,"However, controlling for these characteristics did not alter the inferences of comparisons with the delayed and no prescription groups."
PMC3944682,S107,,Baseline characteristics were similar in all randomised groups (table1).
PMC3944682,S108,,All patients were followed up for one month; further follow-up after the initial month was a mean of 0.84 years (standard deviation 0.36) and was similar in all groups.
PMC3944682,S109,,"The diary symptom severity scale had acceptable internal reliability for days 2-4 (Cronbachâ€™s Î±, day 2, 0.72; day 3, 0.79; day 4, 0.79) and was sensitive to change over the week (standardised response mean 1.60)."
PMC3944682,S110,,The non-recruitment questionnaire had responses from 20 respondents who recruited most of the patients (n=704).
PMC3944682,S111,,"The most common reason (given by 14 recruiters) for eligible patients declining was that the patient was too busy or insufficiently interested, followed by concern about the proposed treatment, and the patient being too unwell."
PMC3944682,S112,,The most common reason given (by 18 of 19 recruiters) for not approaching eligible patients was insufficient time.
PMC3944682,S113,,Table 1 â€‚Baseline characteristic of groups
PMC3944682,S114,,Attrition bias
PMC3944682,S115,,"The characteristics of patients where the primary outcome was not documented were similar to those followed up (n=751) for baseline symptom score (1.0 v 0.98), female sex (82/136 (60%) v 458/744 (62%)), age 16 years or less (31/136 (23%) v 200/744 (27%))."
PMC3944682,S116,,The two groups were similar in diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections (22/135 (16%) v 113/742 (15%)) and otitis media (16/134 (12%) v 66/740 (9%)).
PMC3944682,S117,,Performance bias: compliance with delaying antibiotics
PMC3944682,S118,,"For the 264 patients who completed the main diary and who documented taking antibiotics, the median day that antibiotics were started was day 4 for all the delayed prescription strategies and day 1 for the immediate prescription strategy."
PMC3944682,S119,,Outcomes
PMC3944682,S120,,"For symptom severity, we saw no evidence of a significant interaction between antibiotic strategy and analgesia use (likelihood ratio test Ï‡2 7.7, P=0.47; web appendix 4), nor dosing (4.1, P=0.39) or steam (5.3, P=0.26)."
PMC3944682,S121,,"There was also no evidence that the effect of antibiotic strategy differed after adaptation of the trial to include a no prescription arm, for either symptom severity (3.20, P=0.362) or antibiotic use (1.25, P=0.740)."
PMC3944682,S122,,Main results
PMC3944682,S123,,"In the randomised groups (no prescription and delayed prescription strategies), there was no significant effect of strategy on symptom severity (likelihood ratio test Ï‡2 2.61, P=0.625), duration (4.29, P=0.368), and small differences of 0.1Â°C in temperature control (10.37, P=0.035; table 2 shows individual group comparisons)."
PMC3944682,S124,,"Antibiotic use did not differ significantly between strategies (4.96, P=0.292), with the lowest use (26%; 26/99) reported in the no prescription arm, an average 37% (134/367) in the delayed arms (varying from 33% (28/85) in the collection arm to 39% (35/89) in the patient led arm)."
PMC3944682,S125,,"Belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics was strong but not significantly different between groups (1.62, P=0.805)."
PMC3944682,S126,,"Higher levels of satisfaction were reported for the patient led and collection approaches, although the limited sample size for this outcome resulted in no significant differences overall (2.38, P=0.667)."
PMC3944682,S127,,"Reconsultations in the following month were similar (2.97, P=0.563) and were not significantly different after the first month (4.11, P=0.391)."
PMC3944682,S128,,Table 2 â€‚Effectiveness of antibiotic strategies (randomised groups only)
PMC3944682,S129,,"After including the non-randomised immediate prescription group, there was no significant effect of antibiotic prescribing strategy on symptom severity (likelihood ratio test, Ï‡2 4.05, P=0.543), duration (4.94, P=0.424), or temperature (7.66, P=0.176; web appendix 2 shows individual group comparisons)."
PMC3944682,S130,,"Antibiotic use differed significantly (326, P<0.001) with 97% (270/278) of patients reporting antibiotic use in the immediate arm, and more patients believed antibiotics were very effective (93% (168/180); 36.4, P<0.01) despite immediate antibiotics having no effect on symptom control or duration."
PMC3944682,S131,,Harms
PMC3944682,S132,,Complications were slightly more common in the no prescription group (3/122 (2.5%)) than in the delayed strategy groups (average 6/432 (1.4%)) and similar to the immediate group 8/326 (2.5%; web appendix 3).
PMC3944682,S133,,"In multivariate analysis controlling for baseline symptoms, smoking, and diagnostic group, there were fewer complications in both the delayed and immediate groups but this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 2.37); 0.66 (0.15 to 2.88))."
PMC3944682,S134,,We saw little difference in other side effects reported between groups (web appendix 3).
PMC3944682,S135,,Discussion
PMC3944682,S136,,"To our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies so far to assess the effect of different antibiotic prescribing strategies on symptom control and antibiotic use, and the only trial so far to compare several commonly used methods of delaying antibiotic prescription."
PMC3944682,S137,,"It shows little difference in symptom control between strategies involving no prescription, immediate prescription, or delayed prescription."
PMC3944682,S138,,"This finding contrasts both health professionalsâ€™ behaviour in commonly requiring immediate antibiotics, and the persistently strong beliefs patients have in the effectiveness of antibiotics."
PMC3944682,S139,,"The different ways of using delayed prescription, when the same structured approach is used, had more similar outcomes than previous trial data suggest, although the collection approach performed well on most criteria."
PMC3944682,S140,,Study limitations and strengths
PMC3944682,S141,,"The trial adapted the delayed prescribing strategies during the trial, in response to ongoing debate comparing no prescription with delayed prescription, to include a no prescription group, but there was no evidence of a difference in estimates as a result of the adaptation."
PMC3944682,S142,,"The patient group were broadly defined, comprising a range of respiratory infections, and thus the heterogenous population increases variance, making type II errors more likely."
PMC3944682,S143,,"However, delayed prescribing strategies apply to all infections (that is, this was the meaningful target population), and randomisation groups were well balanced for the main diagnoses."
PMC3944682,S144,,"Participants in the non-randomised group (being prescribed antibiotics immediately) had slightly more severe symptoms at baseline; therefore, comparisons with this group may have been confounded, but controlling for baseline symptoms or other potential confounders did not alter the inferences."
PMC3944682,S145,,The study was not powered to detect a range of antibiotic use that was less than 20% (between 15% and 35%) when comparing the delayed prescribing and no prescribing strategies.
PMC3944682,S146,,"The primary outcome (symptom severity in the first days) should apply in all acute infections, and was reasonably reliable and sensitive to change in this patient group."
PMC3944682,S147,,"Recruitment was slow considering the incidence of respiratory infections, but feedback during and after the study indicated that this study was very easy to recruit to, and that recruitment was limited to time pressures in busy winter clinics as in previous studies,11 13 hence non-recruitment logs were poorly completed."
PMC3944682,S148,,This problem raises questions of generalisability.
PMC3944682,S149,,"However, there was no evidence that patients with more severe symptoms were excluded, because comparisons to recent large, simple observational studies and trials showed patients with slightly more severe symptoms in the current study."
PMC3944682,S150,,"On a scale of 0-3 for mean severity of sore throat at baseline, patients scored 2.4 in the current study versus 2.0 in the DESCARTE study17 18; for mean severity of cough at baseline, patients scored 2.6 in the current study versus 2.2 in the GRACE study.19 20"
PMC3944682,S151,,"The results controlled for potential confounders, but since estimates were not meaningfully altered, the effect of any potential confounding was likely to be limited."
PMC3944682,S152,,"This study was pragmatic so that patients were free not to comply with advice, but in fact compliance was probably reasonable."
PMC3944682,S153,,"Most patients who were asked to delay using antibiotics did not use antibiotics, and those who did use antibiotics on average delayed for several days."
PMC3944682,S154,,The trial was adequately powered for symptom control but was not specifically powered to assess complications.
PMC3944682,S155,,"A strength of the study was that we controlled for symptomatic advice, and we assessed interactions between such advice and antibiotic prescribing strategies: such advice is not normally measured nor assessed in trials of antibiotic strategies."
PMC3944682,S156,,"However, the trial was not formally powered to detect interactions, and thus there was limited precision of the estimates for interactions."
PMC3944682,S157,,The estimates of interaction must be viewed with caution for several reasons.
PMC3944682,S158,,"Firstly, the estimates for the main effects of the other interventions (analgesia, dosing, steam) suggested no effect of these interventions (therefore a ceiling effect resulting in a negative interaction was unlikely)."
PMC3944682,S159,,"Secondly, no interactions were postulated on theoretical grounds in advance."
PMC3944682,S160,,"And thirdly, the spread of the estimates of interactions was consistent with chance."
PMC3944682,S161,,"It was not possible for all outcomes to be included in the follow-ups to collect key outcome data, resulting in less power for outcomes that were only measured in the main diary, such as belief in antibiotics and satisfaction."
PMC3944682,S162,,Main findings
PMC3944682,S163,,We have confirmed that the use of delayed prescriptions is likely to be associated with fewer than 40% of patients using antibiotics.
PMC3944682,S164,,"This finding is consistent with the systematic reviews,8 9 10 but unlike the systematic reviews, we did not confirm poor symptom control with delayed prescribing."
PMC3944682,S165,,The good symptom control in the current study could indicate that all patients were given structured advice about analgesic use.
PMC3944682,S166,,"The delayed groups reported slightly higher antibiotic use than the no prescription group, in line with previous evidence.8 9 10"
PMC3944682,S167,,"About a quarter of patients not initially prescribed antibiotics ended up using them, as opposed to a little more than a third of patients given a delayed prescription."
PMC3944682,S168,,"The previous systematic reviews of delayed prescription documented variation between the antibiotic redemption rates for different strategies of delayed prescription,8 9 10 with higher redemption rates for some studies using the patient led approach."
PMC3944682,S169,,"We documented similar outcomes in our study, but had the advantage of the same approach to advice for each strategy."
PMC3944682,S170,,"Therefore, the larger differences observed between previous studies may not reflect differences in the methods of delayed prescribing themselves."
PMC3944682,S171,,Complications occurred in about 2-3% of patients given no antibiotic prescription compared with 1% of the delayed groups.
PMC3944682,S172,,"The current study was not designed to detect differences in complications, but a recent large observational study of antibiotic prescribing strategies for sore throat (DESCARTE study, n=14â€‰610, led by PL17) has confirmed significant reductions in complication rates using delayed or immediate prescriptions of the same order as the current study.18"
PMC3944682,S173,,"There was little to choose between the different groups of delayed prescribing, but there may be marginal preference for the collection group, which had the most data from previous trials."
PMC3944682,S174,,"In the current study, patients randomised to the collection strategy had a slightly lower use of antibiotics than the other delayed strategiesâ€”presumably due to the hurdle of having to return to the surgery for the prescriptionâ€”as well as higher satisfaction rates and the lowest reconsultation rates."
PMC3944682,S175,,What is already known on this topic
PMC3944682,S176,,Strategies involving no antibiotic prescription or delayed antibiotic prescription are common in managing respiratory tract infections
PMC3944682,S177,,"But systematic reviews have suggested that delayed prescription could result in worse symptom control than immediate use of antibiotics, and could lead to higher antibiotic use than a no prescription strategy"
PMC3944682,S178,,"Different methods of delaying prescriptions (such as giving prescriptions with instructions, leaving prescriptions for collection, post-dating prescriptions, or requesting recontact) have been used but not directly compared"
PMC3944682,S179,,What this study adds
PMC3944682,S180,,"There is probably little difference in symptom control in the short term between strategies of delayed prescription, no prescription, or immediate prescription, despite strong belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics among patients"
PMC3944682,S181,,Both no and delayed antibiotic prescription result in the minority of patients using antibiotics
PMC3944682,S182,,"With clear guidance, any strategy of delayed prescribing is likely to result in fewer than 40% of patients using antibiotics"

PMC4066691,S26,,Background
PMC4066691,S27,,"Currently, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the de facto first-line therapy for the management of poorly controlled, persistent asthma."
PMC4066691,S28,,"In accordance with the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines [1], for patients with moderate asthma who remain symptomatic despite using ICS, therapy is typically â€˜stepped upâ€™ by increasing the ICS dose and/or adding a long-acting Î_2-agonist (LABA) to the maintenance treatment regimen."
PMC4066691,S29,,"Leukotriene modifiers or sustained-release theophylline, added on to low-dose ICS, are alternative options for these patients."
PMC4066691,S30,,"Despite this range of therapeutic choices, at least 40% of patients with asthma have poorly controlled disease [2-4]."
PMC4066691,S31,,"Further, in patients who fail to gain control with an ICSâ€‰+â€‰LABA fixed-dose combination, the remaining options, such as further upwards titration of ICS, systemic glucocorticosteroids and anti-immunoglobulin E therapy, may have several limitations with respect to side effects, risk:benefit ratio, convenience and efficacy [1,5,6]."
PMC4066691,S32,,"Tiotropium, a once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator, is the established first-line maintenance bronchodilator for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [7,8]."
PMC4066691,S33,,"Recently, a number of clinical trials have investigated tiotropium as add-on to at least ICS for the long-term control of asthma, across a range of severities."
PMC4066691,S34,,"In the investigator-led TALC trial (Tiotropium Bromide as an Alternative to Increased Inhaled Glucocorticoid in Patients Inadequately Controlled on a Lower Dose of Inhaled Corticosteroid; three-way crossover, 14Â weeks per treatment, 210 patients), improvements in lung function in patients with asthma treated with tiotropium (via HandiHalerÂ®; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) plus beclomethasone (two puffs of 40Â Î_g, twice daily) were shown to be superior to a doubling of the ICS dose and similar to the addition of salmeterol [9]."
PMC4066691,S35,,"In a 16-week proof-of-concept trial in B16-Arg/Arg patients with symptomatic moderate asthma already receiving ICS, tiotropium 5Â Î_g (administered via the RespimatÂ® SoftMistâ„¢ inhaler [hereinafter referred to as tiotropium RespimatÂ®; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG]) was superior to placebo RespimatÂ® and non-inferior to salmeterol [10]."
PMC4066691,S36,,"A second proof-of-concept study (three-way crossover, 8Â weeks per treatment) in patients with more severe disease â€“ severe persistent asthma, and receiving ICSâ€‰+â€‰LABA â€“ demonstrated that lung function improved significantly with tiotropium RespimatÂ® 10Â Î_g or 5Â Î_g [11]."
PMC4066691,S37,,"Slightly higher peak forced expiratory volume in 1Â second (FEV1) responses were observed in the 10Â Î_g arm [11], and there were statistically significant improvements in pre-dose morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEFam and PEFpm) with 10Â Î_g versus 5Â Î_g."
PMC4066691,S38,,"Kerstjens and colleagues subsequently reported results from two long-term, replicate, 1-year Phase III trials of tiotropium RespimatÂ® 5Â Î_g, also in patients with symptomatic severe asthma despite using ICSâ€‰+â€‰LABA."
PMC4066691,S39,,"In this cohort of 912 patients, tiotropium RespimatÂ® 5Â Î_g, administered as add-on to ICSâ€‰+â€‰LABA, significantly reduced the risk of severe exacerbations and improved lung function, compared with placebo RespimatÂ® as add-on to ICSâ€‰+â€‰LABA [12]."
PMC4066691,S40,,"In light of the findings with the 10Â Î_g and 5Â Î_g doses of tiotropium RespimatÂ® (outlined above), the aim of the present study was to further explore the doseâ€“response curve by comparing the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily evening dosing of tiotropium RespimatÂ® 5Â Î_g, 2.5Â Î_g or 1.25Â Î_g, versus placebo RespimatÂ®, each added on to medium-dose ICS, in adult patients with symptomatic moderate asthma."

PMC4066691,S140,,"Further, in all other lung function parameters that were assessed, responses were consistently largest with tiotropium RespimatÂ® 5Â Î_g."
PMC4066691,S141,,"Peak FEV1(0-3h), FEV1 AUC(0-3h), peak FVC(0-3h) and FVC AUC(0-3h) responses were statistically significantly greater with tiotropium RespimatÂ® 5Â Î_g versus either of the lower doses."
PMC4066691,S142,,The adverse-event profile for 5Â Î_g was comparable with that for lower doses and placebo RespimatÂ®.
PMC4066691,S143,,"In exploratory analyses, we observed a statistically significant reduction in ACQ-7 scores at the end of each 4-week treatment period with each of the three tiotropium RespimatÂ® doses."
PMC4066691,S144,,"However, the crossover design and the relatively short, 4-week, treatment periods are limitations with respect to drawing conclusions from the ACQ-7 score analysis."

PMC4085478,S36,,"The novel treatment of modified release PC was based on the observation that specifically patients with UC had a low intrinsic mucus PC content that reduces the hydrophobic barrier function of the intestinal mucus (10,11)."
PMC4085478,S37,,"Colonic bacteria may then permeate the intestinal mucus barrier, and the consecutive unspecific but aggressive immune responses lead to inflammation and ulceration (12)."
PMC4085478,S38,,"Moreover, the intrinsic anti-inflammatory property of PC is lacking which, in turn, perpetuates the mucosal damage (13,14)."
PMC4085478,S39,,"The purpose of modified release PC is to reconstitute the low mucus PC reservoir and to re-establish the mucosal barrier (9,15,16,17)."

PMC4085478,S97,,Statistics
PMC4085478,S119,,RESULTS
PMC4085478,S120,,The study was conducted between November 2009 and December 2010.
PMC4085478,S121,,"A total of 175 patients were screened, of which 156 UC patients (119 in Germany, 22 in Lithuania, and 15 in Romania) were randomized and treated (see Figure 1)."
PMC4085478,S122,,"When we received the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee to continue the study as planned, we had already randomized 12 patients more than the planned 144 patients; the independent data monitoring committee then recommended including these additional patients in the analyses."
PMC4085478,S123,,"In total, 14, 12, 6, and 7 patients of the placebo, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2â€‰g LT-02 groups, respectively, terminated the study prematurely after randomization, most frequently at their own request owing to the lack of efficacy or AEs."
PMC4085478,S124,,"In addition, 18 patients did not return all empty sachets of study medication and were therefore classified as noncompliant (7 placebo, 6 0.8â€‰g LT-02, 2 1.6â€‰g LT-02, and 3 3.2â€‰g LT-02 patients)."
PMC4085478,S125,,"One placebo patient suffered a serious adverse event (SAE; atrial fibrillation) and was unblinded prematurely; one patient in the 3.2â€‰g LT-02 group was accidentally unblinded by a peripheral study nurse, but remained single-blinded."
PMC4085478,S126,,Table 1 Key demographic and baseline characteristics
PMC4085478,S127,,"Overall, disease-specific baseline characteristics indicated no major differences across the four patient groups (Table 1)."
PMC4085478,S128,,There were no relevant country effects in the interaction analyses.
PMC4085478,S129,,"Concomitant medication was comparable across all study groups, but azathioprine intake was higher in the 0.8â€‰g LT-02 group."
PMC4085478,S130,,"The mean SCCAI varied from 8.5 to 9.0, which represents a moderately active UC population."
PMC4085478,S131,,There were no colectomies reported during the study or during follow-up.
PMC4085478,S132,,Efficacy results
PMC4085478,S133,,Figure 2 Primary end-point analysis.The comparison between placebo and the highest dose group revealed an estimate of âˆ’1.56 and a two-sided P value of 0.03 with a 95% confidence interval of âˆ’2.96 to âˆ’0.16.
PMC4085478,S134,,"SCCAI, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index."
PMC4085478,S135,,We found a higher absolute SCCAI reduction in all LT-02 groups compared with placebo.
PMC4085478,S136,,"In the primary analysis, the disease activity score (SCCAI) in the highest dose group (3.2â€‰g LT-02) dropped from 8.5 to 4.1 (51.7%) compared with 9.0 to 6.0 (33.3%) in the placebo group (two-sided P value=0.030, see Figure 2; the corresponding one-sided P value is P=0.015 which met the goal of the study.)"
PMC4085478,S137,,Figure 3 Time to first symptom resolution: all active LT-02 groups pooled vs. placebo.
PMC4085478,S138,,"LT-02 patients reached the end point of first symptom resolution more than 2 weeks earlier than placebo (P=0.02, preplanned, two-sided log-rank test)."
PMC4085478,S139,,"In total, almost twice as many LT-02 patients reached complete symptom resolution compared with placebo."
PMC4085478,S140,,Table 2 Further secondary end-point analyses
PMC4085478,S141,,The secondary analyses found a remission rate of 31.4% (11/35) in the highest LT-02 dose group compared with 15% (6/40) under placebo (P=0.09; two-sided likelihood ratio Ï‡2 test; Appendix Figure A2).
PMC4085478,S142,,The response rates increased from 24/40 (60%) under placebo to 29/35 (83%) in the highest LT-02 dose group (P=0.030; two-sided likelihood ratio Ï‡2 test; Table 2).
PMC4085478,S143,,The number needed to treat for LT-02 in mesalazine-refractory UC was 6.1 to reach complete remission and 4.3 to reach clinical response.
PMC4085478,S144,,"The rate for achievement of mucosal healing was 32.5% in the placebo group compared with 47.4% in the pooled LT-02 groups (P=0.098, Table 2); the rate for histologic healing (histologic index=1) was 20.0% in the placebo compared with 35.3% in the LT-02 groups (P=0.016)."
PMC4085478,S145,,The time to first symptom resolution was 33 days in the median among LT-02 responders.
PMC4085478,S146,,Symptom resolution occurred âˆ_2 weeks earlier and was almost twice as often under LT-02 treatment than under placebo treatment (P=0.02; Figure 3).

PMC4085478,S148,,"Table 3 Drug-related adverse events as defined by the site investigator, n (%)"
PMC4085478,S149,,"Safety evaluations of lab results, vital signs, and physical examinations did not show any treatment-related changes between the study groups."
PMC4085478,S150,,The frequency of possibly drug-related AEs was low in all four study arms.
PMC4085478,S151,,Mainly mild or moderate treatment-related AEs occurred.
PMC4085478,S152,,There were 17 treatment-emergent AEs (48.6%) in the highest dose group (0 SAEs) compared with 22 (55%) in the placebo group (4 SAEs).
PMC4085478,S153,,There were no relevant or significant differences of adverse drug reactions between the treatment groups (see Table 3; Appendix Table A2).
PMC4085478,S154,,"In all, 12 patients experienced 17 SAEs; these consisted of 5, 2, and 1 patient in the 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2â€‰g LT-02 treatment groups, respectively, and 4 patients in the placebo group."
PMC4085478,S155,,"Only one SAE, atrial fibrillation, was assessed as being possibly related to study treatment; it occurred in the placebo group."
PMC4085478,S156,,Follow-up
PMC4085478,S157,,Responders of all study arms entered an 8-week follow-up period without study medication.
PMC4085478,S158,,"Patients in the LT-02 group were able to avoid relapses over a longer period and in a higher percentage of patients (P=0.02, log-rank test; Appendix Figure A3)."
PMC4085478,S159,,DISCUSSION
PMC4085478,S160,,"The aim of the current trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and optimal dose of a newly designed, modified release formulation of highly purified PC (LT-02)."
PMC4085478,S161,,This drug is a first-in-class therapy for UC and the first treatment with a mucoprotective substance to reach study phase II or phase III.
PMC4085478,S162,,"The primary analysis revealed a statistically significant treatment effect for LT-02 in mesalazine-refractory UC: whereas the two lower doses of LT-02 showed improvement that was statistically not significant, the highest LT-02 dose group (3.2â€‰g) showed a significantly higher drop of the index compared with placebo (P=0.030, two sided)."
PMC4085478,S163,,"Mixed modeling was performed as sensitivity analyses for the SCCAI primary model to confirm the primary analysis: all data of visits under treatment were used as the dependent variable (without applying LOCF), with repeated measures on the same patient taken into account with three different versions of simple covariance structures of residuals."
PMC4085478,S164,,"Fixed effects included into the mixed model were the same as in the primary model, namely dose group, SCCAI at baseline, and extent of disease."
PMC4085478,S165,,The resulting two-sided P values for the primary comparison of 3.2â€‰g LT-02 vs. placebo were between 0.008 and 0.036 depending on the type of the covariance structure used.
PMC4085478,S166,,These analyses confirmed the statistical significance of the originally planned primary analysis.
PMC4085478,S167,,"SCCAI subcategory analyses revealed that â€œExtraintestinal Manifestationsâ€ù showed no significant differences between LT-02 and placebo, and this is not surprising for a topical and not systemic agent."
PMC4085478,S168,,"â€œBowel Movements at Nightâ€ù indicated a statistical trend with a two-sided P value of 0.127, whereas â€œStool Urgencyâ€ù resulted in a P value of 0.006."
PMC4085478,S169,,"(Both categories represent major patient complaints: nightly defecation is highly disruptive and affects patients' recreation; stool urgency requires immediate access to bathrooms, which may result in pain and humiliating stool incontinence.) â€œBowel Frequency,â€ù â€œGeneral Wellbeing,â€ù and â€œBlood In Stoolâ€ù show borderline significant P values that are not much higher compared with those of the total SCCAI."
PMC4085478,S170,,"In the main secondary outcome analyses, we found that the clinical and histologic remission rates doubled between placebo and the highest LT-02 dose groups."
PMC4085478,S171,,"Approximately 50% more LT-02 than placebo patients achieved mucosal healing (P<0.1, Table 2)."
PMC4085478,S172,,"As the applied LOCF analyses bear the risk of underestimating treatment effects (27), we conducted a sensitivity analysis upon request of reviewers with dropouts treated as failures: the effects that we observed magnified and indicated statistical significance (Table 2)."
PMC4085478,S173,,The preplanned analyses of clinical response and time to first symptom resolution also revealed statistically significant results (Figure 3).
PMC4085478,S174,,Follow-up analyses revealed that placebo patients relapsed earlier and more frequently than LT-02 patients (P=0.02; Appendix Figure A3).
PMC4085478,S175,,This underlines the LT-02 efficacy as the placebo effect in the placebo group became more apparent.
PMC4085478,S176,,The treatment effect of LT-02 seems to last longer than the period of actual drug intake.
PMC4085478,S177,,We believe that an interruption of the vicious cycle of barrier defect and mucosal damage might be responsible for this effect.
PMC4085478,S178,,"The treatment effects in mesalazine-refractory UC were good (number needed to treat was 6.1 for complete remission and 4.3 for clinical response), and the safety profile was excellent: AEs occurred equally among placebo and LT-02 groups and no LT-02-related SAE occurred."
PMC4085478,S179,,Limitations
PMC4085478,S180,,The primary end point â€œchanges of disease activity indexâ€ù instead of remission rates is unusual for a larger study.
PMC4085478,S181,,"The clinical effect and the practical impact of treatment may be overestimated with the use of numerical changes, but they detect clinical effects in smaller study populations."
PMC4085478,S182,,Information is lost by qualitative variables such as remission rates.
PMC4085478,S183,,"This is why quantitative target variables are important in dose-finding studies, as they have a higher sensitivity concerning dose-response effects of a new drug such as LT-02."
PMC4085478,S184,,"On the basis of this primary, quantitative end point, we had planned to include 36 evaluable patients per group."
PMC4085478,S185,,"Remission end points require much higher sample sizes of âˆ_200 patients per group (equals N=800 for this study), and these are targeted for pivotal studies."
PMC4085478,S186,,"The small sample size of the current trial resulted in a reduced statistical power for secondary end points, making statistical significance unlikely."
PMC4085478,S187,,"With our small sample size, success rate estimates of qualitative variables have a high variability; statistically significant results or strict dose-response patterns cannot be expected for qualitative parameters such as remission or mucosal healing."
PMC4085478,S188,,Most pivotal studies in UC use the Mayo score instead of the SCCAI.
PMC4085478,S189,,"The European Medicines Agency, EMA, however, states that it does not favor any score, but recommends the use of indices using signs and symptoms rather than endoscopy, as this correlates well with the former but varies strongly between observers (www.tga.gov.au/pdf/euguide/ewp1846306en.pdf)."
PMC4085478,S190,,The SCCAI is the most comprehensive clinical score; it requires no diagnostic interventions and allows for continuous evaluation throughout the study.
PMC4085478,S191,,"Unlike the Mayo or CAI scores, it allows for time-to-event (remission/response) analyses (see Figure 3, Appendix Table A1 and Appendix Figure A3) that are essential for a new drug with an unknown time to treatment response."
PMC4085478,S192,,"The SCCAI is a relatively new, but well-established, score that has been used frequently in clinical studies recently."
PMC4085478,S193,,"Cutoff points for remission (<2.5), relapse (>4.5), and response (index drop >1.5) have been validated (24,25,26)."
PMC4085478,S194,,"As the SCCAI only allows for natural numbers, our end points of remission <3, partial remission â‰_5, and response (SCCAI drop â‰¥2) are equivalent to these cutoffs."
PMC4085478,S195,,"Of the 24 study centers, 9 had <4 patients and an additional 7 centers had <8 patients, and this explains a certain deviation from a better balance between study arms (N varies between 35 and 41)."
PMC4085478,S196,,"This, however, is not an issue because statistical tests are fitted more to simple randomization than to restricted randomization."
PMC4085478,S197,,The randomization ratio was 1:1:1:1 with blocks of four per center.
PMC4085478,S198,,"This could mean a potential limited bias in case of the premature unblinding of a patient, as the investigators might draw conclusions concerning the treatment of the remaining patients at their centers."
PMC4085478,S199,,"In an isolated occurrence, a patient was accidentally unblinded by a study nurse."
PMC4085478,S200,,"As the investigators were completely uninformed regarding the above-described packaging strategy, it is highly unlikely that this could influence the study outcome."
PMC4085478,S201,,"A randomization ratio with blocks of eight would have been preferable, but it was financially not feasible."
PMC4085478,S202,,Some authors expect a two-sided P value for the primary analysis.
PMC4085478,S203,,"A one-sided P value, however, is often used in regulatory superiority studies with a stricter significance level of P=0.025 that equals a two-sided P value of 0.05."
PMC4085478,S204,,"Inferiority to placebo was not assumed, as previous studies had shown superiority."
PMC4085478,S205,,All presented P values are two sided; only the P value for the primary analysis is presented as both one and two sided to facilitate the comparison with the stricter limit of 0.025.
PMC4085478,S206,,Fecal calprotectin is an essential marker in UC at present.
PMC4085478,S207,,"During the planning phase of the study, however, it was not established and was included into the running study."
PMC4085478,S208,,"As the study progressed so fast, the resulting data are too little to be analyzed."
PMC4085478,S209,,Conclusion
PMC4085478,S210,,There is a pressing need for treatment alternatives in refractory UC.
PMC4085478,S211,,The goal of the study with the a priori defined primary end point of changes in disease activity was reached: the disease activity score dropped significantly under 3.2â€‰g LT-02 compared with placebo.
PMC4085478,S212,,"Moreover, the drug was found to be very safe."
PMC4085478,S213,,"Although the improvement of the disease activity in the lower doses (0.8 and 1.6â€‰g LT-02) was not statistically significant compared with placebo, the highest dose was effective and is intended for the planned pivotal studies."
PMC4085478,S214,,The treatment effects of modified release PC appear to correlate with the shift of paradigm from immunological disorder to mucosal barrier dysfunction that has taken place in our understanding of inflammatory bowel disease in recent years.
PMC4085478,S215,,Our findings could possibly further the treatment and understanding of ulcerative colitis.

PMC4145439,S2,,Efficacy and safety of olokizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to TNF inhibitor therapy: outcomes of a randomised Phase IIb study
PMC4145439,S3,,Abstract
PMC4145439,S4,,Objectives
PMC4145439,S5,,"The aim of this 12-week Phase IIb study was to assess the efficacy and safety of olokizumab (OKZ), a humanised anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with moderate-to-severe disease activity who had previously failed tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy."
PMC4145439,S6,,The dose-exposure-response relationship for OKZ was also investigated.
PMC4145439,S7,,Methods
PMC4145439,S8,,"Patients were randomised to one of nine treatment arms receiving placebo (PBO) or OKZ (60, 120 or 240â€…mg) every 4â€…weeks (Q4W) or every 2â€…weeks (Q2W), or 8â€…mg/kg tocilizumab (TCZ) Q4W."
PMC4145439,S9,,"The primary endpoint was change from baseline in DAS28(C-reactive protein, CRP) at Week 12."
PMC4145439,S10,,"Secondary efficacy endpoints were American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20), ACR50 and ACR70 response rates at Week 12."
PMC4145439,S11,,Exploratory analyses included comparisons of OKZ efficacy with TCZ.
PMC4145439,S12,,Results
PMC4145439,S13,,"Across 221 randomised patients, OKZ treatment produced significantly greater reductions in DAS28(CRP) from baseline levels at Week 12, compared to PBO (p<0.001), at all the OKZ doses tested (60â€…mg OKZ p=0.0001, 120 and 240â€…mg OKZ p<0.0001)."
PMC4145439,S14,,"Additionally, ACR20 and ACR50 responses were numerically higher for OKZ than PBO (ACR20: PBO=17.1â€“29.9%, OKZ=32.5â€“60.7%; ACR50: PBO=1.3â€“4.9%, OKZ=11.5â€“33.2%)."
PMC4145439,S15,,"OKZ treatment, at several doses, demonstrated similar efficacy to TCZ across multiple endpoints."
PMC4145439,S16,,Most adverse events were mild or moderate and comparable between OKZ and TCZ treatment groups.
PMC4145439,S17,,Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling demonstrated a shallow dose/exposure response relationship in terms of percentage of patients with DAS28(CRP) <2.6.
PMC4145439,S18,,Conclusions
PMC4145439,S19,,OKZ produced significantly greater reductions in DAS28(CRP) from baseline at Week 12 compared with PBO.

PMC4145439,S23,,Introduction
PMC4145439,S24,,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease which can lead to destruction and physical dysfunction of joints resulting in a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.1"
PMC4145439,S25,,"For patients who have an inadequate response to DMARDs, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are frequently added, usually in combination with methotrexate (MTX).2"
PMC4145439,S26,,"Approximately 40â€“50% of patients receiving TNF inhibitors, however, also have an inadequate response to this treatment.3â€“5"
PMC4145439,S27,,Therapeutic approaches using alternative mechanisms of action are therefore an important unmet need for this patient population.
PMC4145439,S28,,An alternate therapeutic target is the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6).
PMC4145439,S29,,"IL-6 is an important mediator of inflammation and is involved in key immunologic processes underlying the pathology of RA, such as T-cell activation and B-cell proliferation, as well as osteoclast differentiation.6"
PMC4145439,S30,,The amount of IL-6 present in the synovial fluid of patients with RA has been shown to correlate with the severity of synovitis and joint destruction.7â€“9
PMC4145439,S31,,"An anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), has been approved for the treatment of RA.10â€“17"
PMC4145439,S32,,TCZ is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor.18
PMC4145439,S33,,"Olokizumab (OKZ, CDP6038), a humanised monoclonal antibody specific for the IL-6 cytokine, is currently in development for the treatment of RA."
PMC4145439,S34,,"It targets the IL-6 cytokine rather than the receptor, and selectively blocks the final assembly of the signalling complex."
PMC4145439,S35,,"In Phase I (healthy volunteers) and IIa (patients with RA on MTX) clinical trials, OKZ was well tolerated after intravenous and subcutaneous delivery with a median plasma half-life of approximately 31â€…days, 76% bioavailability and no apparent antidrug antibody-mediated clearance.19"
PMC4145439,S36,,OKZ also markedly reduced free IL-6 levels and suppressed C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 12â€…weeks after single-dose subcutaneous administration in patients with RA.20
PMC4145439,S37,,"The primary aims of this Phase IIb, dose-ranging study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OKZ in an active RA population who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy."

PMC4145439,S134,,Non-specific interference by pre-existing immunoglobulins in patientsâ€™ plasma has been previously reported25 26 and was shown to be the case for some of these nominally positive samples with a posthoc analysis.

PMC4145439,S159,,Discussion
PMC4145439,S160,,"In this Phase II study of patients with RA who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy, treatment with OKZ resulted in significantly greater reductions in DAS28(CRP) from baseline levels at Week 12 compared with treatment with PBO."
PMC4145439,S161,,"This improvement was demonstrated at all the OKZ doses tested with generally comparable efficacy and across both dosing frequencies, and was statistically significant for all dose group comparisons (60, 120 or 240â€…mg vs PBO)."
PMC4145439,S162,,"At low OKZ doses, a posthoc analysis showed greater responses in patients who met the criterion of high CRP at study entry compared to all other patients."
PMC4145439,S163,,The primary efficacy endpoint was further supported by the secondary efficacy variables.
PMC4145439,S164,,"Estimated ACR20 and ACR50 response rates at Week 12 were numerically higher in all OKZ treatment arms than PBO groups, although the study was not powered to show a statistical difference in the ACR response rates."
PMC4145439,S165,,Few patients in any treatment group were ACR70 responders.
PMC4145439,S166,,"Comparisons of exploratory efficacy variables, including health outcomes endpoints generally suggested greater improvement in OKZ treatment groups compared with the PBO groups."
PMC4145439,S167,,"Overall, exploratory comparison showed similar responses to subcutaneous OKZ treatment and intravenously administered TCZ across multiple efficacy endpoints and for several OKZ treatment groups."
PMC4145439,S168,,"Reported TEAEs in this study were consistent with the safety profile expected of this class of drug, with no new safety signals identified."
PMC4145439,S169,,"Commonly reported TEAEs in OKZ treated patients included gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations (primarily upper and lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections) and nervous system disorders, which is qualitatively similar to the safety profile observed for TCZ in this and other previously published trials, as well as other anti-IL6â€…s in development.11 27â€“31"
PMC4145439,S170,,"These TEAEs occurred at similar frequencies in the PBO, OKZ and TCZ treated groups."
PMC4145439,S171,,There were no incidences of diverticulitis or gastrointestinal perforations reported during the study.
PMC4145439,S172,,"In accordance with the role of IL-6 in immune regulation, inflammation and haematopoiesis, reported TEAEs included increases in AST, ALT and lipids, and decreases in neutrophil levels."
PMC4145439,S173,,"As expected, small increases from baseline in median total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides and decreases in neutrophils were observed in each of the active treatment arms, including the TCZ group, throughout the 12-week study."
PMC4145439,S174,,No patients fulfilled the Hy's law criteria for drug-induced liver injury.
PMC4145439,S175,,"Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in nature, with no deaths."
PMC4145439,S176,,"In the OKZ and TCZ treatment groups, there were no opportunistic infections, but two serious infections (one pneumonia and one abscess reported in patients treated with each study drug)."
PMC4145439,S177,,Injection site reactions were more commonly reported after injection with OKZ compared with PBO or TCZ which was administered intravenously.
PMC4145439,S178,,"The highest incidence was reported in the OKZ 240â€…mg Q2W group, in accordance with these patients receiving the greatest number of active subcutaneous injections."
PMC4145439,S179,,No serious injection site reactions were reported.
PMC4145439,S180,,The limitations of this study included the small number of patients in each treatment group and the resultant lack of statistical power for comparisons beyond the primary endpoint.
PMC4145439,S181,,"This small sample size, along with the heterogeneity of the study population, resulted in high variability, quantified by the PBO groups."
PMC4145439,S182,,Although PBO patients were randomised to nominal â€˜Q4Wâ€™ and â€˜Q2Wâ€™ groups they received identical treatments at all visits and results in these groups (while demonstrating overall consistency with previous published RA clinical trials) were variable.
PMC4145439,S183,,"Despite this, OKZ across all treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the predefined primary efficacy variable."
PMC4145439,S184,,"Graphical comparisons of different doses and dosing regimens did not reveal significant differences in responses; integration of study data and analysis using PK/PD methodology revealed dose-exposure-response relationships for DAS28(CRP) and ACR20 endpoints, albeit shallow; no significant impact of the number of previous failed treatments with TNF inhibitors could be observed, which may also be due to small sample sizes."
PMC4145439,S185,,This study used a primary endpoint of 12â€…weeks.
PMC4145439,S186,,Study duration is another potential study limitation given the long half-life of OKZ (31â€…days19) and the time required to plateau plasma concentration drug levels.
PMC4145439,S187,,"Additionally, in this study, all patients had previously been treated with, and failed to respond to, at least one TNF inhibitor, and thus, results seen here may not be directly applicable to the wider RA population."
PMC4145439,S188,,"In addition to OKZ, several other antibodies targeting the IL-6 pathway are in development.29â€“33"
PMC4145439,S189,,"Potential differentiating factors for these antibodies include targeted protein (IL-6 or IL6R), targeted step of the IL-6 signalling complex cascade, route of administration, level of humanisation, immunoglobulin type and/or antibody construct."
PMC4145439,S190,,"However, these antibodies are currently in Phase II or III of clinical development."
PMC4145439,S191,,"Thus, the impact of these factors on efficacy and/or safety has not yet been fully evaluated."
PMC4145439,S192,,"The data presented here show that in this Phase II trial, OKZ demonstrated improvements in multiple efficacy variables compared with PBO in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy with results comparable to TCZ."
PMC4145439,S193,,"Additionally, the safety profile following treatment with OKZ at doses up to 240â€…mg Q2W was in line with expectations for this class of drug, with a TEAE and laboratory test profile consistent with the use of IL-6 targeted therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe RA."
PMC4145439,S194,,"Taken together, the results of this Phase II study are encouraging and support further studies with OKZ in RA."

PMC4145444,S14,,Results
PMC4145444,S15,,"The median (range) age of enrolled children was 46 (15â€“102) months, and baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups."
PMC4145444,S16,,"Mean (Â±SD) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was 30.2Â±13.2â€…nmol/L at baseline, and 29 (43%) had values <30â€…nmol/L. Baseline alkaline phosphatase and radiographic scores were unrelated to vitamin D status."
PMC4145444,S17,,"Of the 68 children (94% of original cohort) who completed 24â€…weeks of treatment, 29 (67%) in the Ca+D group and 11 (44%) in the Ca group achieved the primary outcome (p=0.06)."
PMC4145444,S18,,Baseline 25(OH)D did not alter treatment group effects (p=0.99 for interaction).

PMC4145444,S25,,What is known about this topic?
PMC4145444,S26,,Nutritional rickets in most Nigerian children results from inadequate dietary calcium intake and responds to calcium supplementation.Children with inadequate calcium intake may have greater vitamin D requirements.
PMC4145444,S27,,What this study adds?
PMC4145444,S28,,Vitamin D in addition to treatment with calcium carbonate as limestone facilitates more rapid healing of rickets in children with calcium-deficiency rickets.The response to treatment with vitamin D and calcium was independent of baseline 25(OH)D concentrations.A greater increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration over the course of treatment was predictive of successful healing of rickets.
PMC4145444,S29,,Introduction
PMC4145444,S30,,"Nutritional rickets in most Nigerian children results from inadequate dietary calcium intake, rather than vitamin D deficiency.1"
PMC4145444,S31,,"However, vitamin D requirements and its metabolism in children with dietary calcium-deficiency rickets have not been adequately explored."
PMC4145444,S32,,"Children with calcium-deficiency rickets have elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) values, which nearly doubles in response to a single oral dose of vitamin D.2 3"
PMC4145444,S33,,"This increase in 1,25(OH)2D in children with calcium-deficiency rickets is suggestive of increased vitamin D requirements and a relative vitamin D deficiency, despite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) values being greater than those generally considered indicative of deficiency.4"
PMC4145444,S34,,"In a randomised controlled trial, we found that treatment with vitamin D alone was less effective in healing rickets than treatment with calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D.1"
PMC4145444,S35,,"The primary outcome of the trial was the combined endpoint of radiographic healing and normalisation of serum alkaline phosphatase, and this outcome did not differ between the groups that received calcium with or without vitamin D. When compared with treatment with calcium alone, the combination of calcium and vitamin D resulted in a more rapid initial decline in alkaline phosphatase and improvement in radiographic score."
PMC4145444,S36,,"Although vitamin D status, as measured by serum 25(OH)D, improved during treatment with calcium alone, the rise in 25(OH)D and the decline in 1,25(OH)2D were greater when calcium was combined with vitamin D than with calcium alone."
PMC4145444,S37,,The objective of this randomised controlled trial was to compare the response of rickets to calcium treatment as limestone with and without vitamin D supplementation.

PMC4145444,S113,,"We found that vitamin D facilitates more rapid healing, improves vitamin D status and had a marginally significant effect on recovery at the end of 6â€…months in children with calcium-deficiency rickets treated with calcium carbonate as limestone."
PMC4145444,S114,,The response to treatment with vitamin D and calcium was independent of baseline 25(OH)D concentrations.
PMC4145444,S115,,"However, a response to treatment with either calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D was associated with a greater increase in 25(OH)D concentrations over the period of therapy than in those who did not respond as well."
PMC4145444,S116,,"In a previous study in this population, we found no difference in the primary outcome between groups that received calcium with or without vitamin D, but there was a more rapid initial decline in alkaline phosphatase in the group that received the combination of vitamin D and calcium.1"
PMC4145444,S117,,"In comparing the results of the two studies, we noted that 61% of the calcium group in the earlier study achieved the primary outcome compared with only 44% in the current study."
PMC4145444,S118,,"Baseline characteristics of children with rickets were similar, and we used the same combined endpoint in both studies."
PMC4145444,S119,,"However, several differences between the interventions in the two studies may account for the disparate results."
PMC4145444,S120,,"In the previous study, children were treated with calcium as calcium carbonate tablets and vitamin D3 as 600â€…000â€…IU injections every 3â€…months, whereas in the present study, we used limestone with a greater dose of elemental calcium and vitamin D2 50â€…000â€…IU given orally every 4â€…weeks."
PMC4145444,S121,,Calcium as limestone may be less bioavailable than calcium in tablets of calcium carbonate.
PMC4145444,S122,,"Because the limestone was mixed with food or porridge, children who did not finish their food would not have had a complete dose."
PMC4145444,S123,,"This may explain, in part, the difference in outcomes between the calcium groups in the two trials."
PMC4145444,S124,,The primary outcome in the Ca+D group was achieved in 67% of subjects in this study compared with 58% in our prior study.
PMC4145444,S125,,"Compared with our earlier study, the superior outcome of the Ca+D group in this study may reflect an effect of dosing of vitamin D every 4â€…weeks as opposed to a larger dose administered every 12â€…weeks."
PMC4145444,S126,,Effective healing of rickets in the Ca+D group indicates that the bioavailability of calcium from limestone was sufficient when vitamin D status was optimised.
PMC4145444,S127,,Limestone can be used as an inexpensive source of calcium in low-income countries where rickets is prevalent.
PMC4145444,S128,,"In comparison, a recent trial in 67 children with nutritional rickets in India compared treatment with calcium, vitamin D or the combination for 12â€…weeks.10"
PMC4145444,S129,,"Normal serum alkaline phosphatase and complete radiological healing were observed in 12%, 16% and 50% of subjects in the calcium, vitamin D and combination groups, respectively."
PMC4145444,S130,,"The Indian children were younger (median age 14â€…months) than children in our trial, but baseline 25(OH)D values (median 34â€…nmol/L) were similar."
PMC4145444,S131,,The authors concluded that treatment of children with nutritional rickets and low dietary calcium intakes responded better to the combination of vitamin D and calcium than to calcium alone.
PMC4145444,S132,,"Their trial did not examine healing of rickets beyond 12â€…weeks, the relationship of 25(OH)D with treatment response or the effect of treatment on bone density."
PMC4145444,S133,,"It is not clear why vitamin D enhances healing of rickets in children with calcium-deficiency rickets, even in those with adequate vitamin D status, as we have previously shown excellent intestinal calcium absorption without D supplementation."
PMC4145444,S134,,"Vitamin D does not improve the already maximal fractional calcium absorption in Nigerian children with rickets, even in those with low serum 25(OH)D concentrations.11"
PMC4145444,S135,,Studies in adults indicate that intestinal calcium absorption is not significantly reduced until 25(OH)D concentrations are â‰_10â€…nmol/L.12
PMC4145444,S136,,Current evidence indicates that vitamin D requirements are greater when dietary calcium intakes are low.3 13
PMC4145444,S137,,"This is consistent with our findings in Nigerian children with calcium-deficiency rickets, who demonstrate a marked increase in 1,25(OH)2D in response to vitamin D administration.2 3"
PMC4145444,S138,,These findings suggest that vitamin D metabolites may have a direct or indirect effect on bone mineralisation by mechanisms other than calcium absorption.14
PMC4145444,S139,,"Vitamin D also promotes intestinal phosphorus absorption and mediates phosphorus metabolism, which may also be critical for healing of the rickets."

PMC4145444,S142,,"We have previously demonstrated that calcium supplementation increases forearm bone density in young Nigerian children,15 but this increase was not sustained after withdrawal of calcium supplementation.16"
PMC4145444,S143,,One of the limitations of our study was that we did not attain our target enrolment of 40 subjects in each group before the study concluded.
PMC4145444,S144,,The power of our sample size to detect the observed difference in the primary outcome (67% vs 44%) with 95% CI was 46%.
PMC4145444,S145,,"However, this lack of power does not affect the conclusions related to our findings that were statistically significant."
PMC4145444,S146,,"Coin toss randomisation led to unequal group sizes, but this method of simple randomisation is less error prone than restricted randomisation, because it is entirely unpredictable."
PMC4145444,S147,,"However, it is more likely to generate baseline imbalances between the characteristics of the treatment groups, which we did not observe in our trial."
PMC4145444,S148,,"Trials that are numerically imbalanced are still scientifically sound, and loss of power occurs only when the imbalance is much greater than 2:1.17"

PMC4213545,S8,,"In this 24-week double-blind study, 1692 patients with stable COPD were equally randomized to twice-daily treatment with FDC aclidinium 400Â Î_g/formoterol 12Â Î_g (ACL400/FOR12 FDC), FDC aclidinium 400Â Î_g/formoterol 6Â Î_g (ACL400/FOR6 FDC), aclidinium 400Â Î_g, formoterol 12Â Î_g, or placebo administered by a multidose dry powder inhaler (GenuairÂ®/PressairÂ®)*."
PMC4213545,S9,,Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 24 in 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 (FDCs versus aclidinium) and change from baseline to week 24 in morning predose (trough) FEV1 (FDCs versus formoterol).

PMC4213545,S31,,"Studies investigating the free combination of LAMA and LABA therapies (via two separate inhalers) in patients with COPD have shown improved bronchodilation and reduced rescue medication use compared with monotherapy [2,3,5,6]."
PMC4213545,S32,,Treatment with either aclidinium bromide (a LAMA) 400Â Î_g twice-daily (BID) or formoterol fumarate (a LABA) 12Â Î_g twice daily improves lung function and reduces COPD symptoms while being well tolerated [7-12].

PMC4213545,S206,,Discussion
PMC4213545,S207,,"An FDC comprising bronchodilators with complementary mechanisms of action may improve lung function, while offering patients the convenience of drug delivery via a single device without increasing the risk for adverse events [20]."
PMC4213545,S208,,"Though the interaction between LAMAs and LABAs has not been definitively determined, LABAs have been shown to enhance the bronchodilatory effect of LAMAs through a decrease in acetylcholine transmission that leads to a reduction in bronchoconstriction, while LAMAs amplify the effect of LABAs by blocking the muscarinic receptors targeted by acetylcholine, resulting in further bronchodilation [3,21,22]."
PMC4213545,S209,,"Thus, a fixed-dose combination of a LAMA and LABA is an important therapeutic option, providing patients with more convenient drug delivery and the potential for improved compliance."
PMC4213545,S210,,"In this trial, treatment with the LAMA/LABA fixed dose combination of aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g for 24Â weeks resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements for the coprimary measures of lung function: 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 versus aclidinium monotherapy (contribution of formoterol) and morning trough FEV1 versus formoterol (contribution of aclidinium)."
PMC4213545,S211,,"The coprimary endpoints in the AUGMENT COPD study reported here reflect FDA guidance regarding fixed-dose combination drugs (ie, each component of the fixed-dose combination must make a contribution to the claimed effects [23])."
PMC4213545,S212,,One aspect behind the rationale for combining aclidinium and formoterol for this FDC was the difference in time course for effective bronchodilation between the two drugs.
PMC4213545,S213,,"Formoterol was expected to provide a rapid onset of action while the contribution of aclidinium was expected to occur over many hours (at trough) [11,24]."
PMC4213545,S214,,The trial was thus powered to detect differences in the prespecified coprimary endpoint comparisons: 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 for the FDCs versus aclidinium (to observe the early contribution of formoterol) and trough FEV1 for the FDCs versus formoterol (to observe the contribution of aclidinium over many hours).
PMC4213545,S215,,Any other comparisons for these outcomes were considered supportive in nature.
PMC4213545,S216,,"At study end, the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12Â Î_g FDC provided an additional 45Â mL in trough FEV1 from baseline (contribution of aclidinium), while the contribution of formoterol to the FDC (aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g versus aclidinium) was 28Â mL, indicating that aclidinium provided greater bronchodilation."
PMC4213545,S217,,Results for trough FEV1 over the course of the study support the endpoint observation that the contribution of formoterol as a component of the FDC was smaller than that of aclidinium.
PMC4213545,S218,,"Additionally, trough FEV1 values for both FDCs were numerically greater than aclidinium at all timepoints throughout the study, a result that is supportive of the observation that the FDCs provide greater bronchodilation than either monotherapy component alone."
PMC4213545,S219,,"Throughout the study, improvements in lung function with aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g, which were numerically greater than those with aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/6Â Î_g, were generally similar to the results observed in a similarly designed study (ACLIFORM COPD) [25]."
PMC4213545,S220,,Results from this trial also demonstrate rapid bronchodilation with aclidinium/formoterol FDC treatment (within 5Â minutes of dosing) that was sustained and clinically meaningful in patients with COPD.
PMC4213545,S221,,"Both aclidinium/formoterol FDCs had safety profiles generally similar to that of each monotherapy, though there were a numerically greater percentage of FDC- and aclidinium-treated patients who experienced any AE compared with those treated with formoterol."
PMC4213545,S222,,The incidence of MACE was comparable among all active treatment groups.
PMC4213545,S223,,"Together, these results indicate that treatment with a fixed-dose combination of aclidinium/formoterol achieves a level of bronchodilation greater than either monotherapy component and is well-tolerated in patients with moderate to severe COPD."
PMC4213545,S224,,The therapeutic benefits on lung function derived from treatment with the aclidinium/formoterol FDCs exceeded the recommended MCID of 100Â mL in 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 versus placebo and were consistently significantly greater than those of the monotherapies.
PMC4213545,S225,,"These improvements were observed from the first timepoint assessed until the end of the study, demonstrating sustained bronchodilation throughout 24Â weeks of treatment."
PMC4213545,S226,,"Onset of bronchodilation (>15% increase from baseline in FEV1) with aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g was observed as early as 5Â minutes after the first dose, similar to that of formoterolâ€”a LABA known to have a fast onset of action [26]."
PMC4213545,S227,,"The improved efficacy with the aclidinium/formoterol LAMA/LABA combination over the monotherapy components and placebo may be attributed to complementary pharmacodynamic profiles of these 2 bronchodilators: direct bronchodilation by the Î_2-agonist, formoterol, provides rapid onset of action, while reduction in bronchoconstriction by the antimuscarinic, aclidinium, prolongs duration of bronchodilation [24,27]."
PMC4213545,S228,,"As rapid onset of effect has been associated with better patient compliance [28,29], the onset of action observed with the aclidinium/formoterol FDCs may have a positive effect on medication adherence in clinical practice."
PMC4213545,S229,,"Although spirometric outcomes are important in assessing airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, clinical measures of health status have been shown to correlate better with symptoms such as breathlessness [30,31]â€”one of the most troublesome symptoms of the disease that often contributes to limitations in patientsâ€™ activities [30-32]."
PMC4213545,S230,,"Following 24Â weeks of treatment, improvements in SGRQ total score exceeded the MCID over placebo in patients treated with either aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g or aclidinium monotherapy."
PMC4213545,S231,,Patients treated with aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g also experienced improvements in TDI focal score that exceeded the MCID over placebo.
PMC4213545,S232,,"Compared with placebo, a significantly greater percentage of aclidinium/formoterol FDC 400/12Â Î_g and 400/6Â Î_g-treated patients reached the MCID for both SGRQ and TDI at all study visits."
PMC4213545,S233,,"These results support the clinical benefit of aclidinium/formoterol FDCs in improving health status and in reducing breathlessness, important treatment goals for the effective management of COPD [32]."
PMC4213545,S234,,A recently published review of the applicability of MCIDs in COPD trials outlines numerous challenges when comparing combination therapies to monotherapy [33].
PMC4213545,S235,,The authors indicate that improvements in various outcome measures with combination therapy over monotherapy should not be expected to exceed those of monotherapy over placebo or to produce a result that would reach an MCID.
PMC4213545,S236,,"Further, the authors suggest that MCIDs or responder rates derived from trials comparing a single active agent to placebo may not be applicable to combination therapy trials in which the comparison is to each monotherapy component."
PMC4213545,S237,,It is not surprising that the observed differences between monotherapy and placebo are often greater than the differences between combination therapy and the monotherapy components [34].
PMC4213545,S238,,"To describe the additional proportion of patients who may experience improvements at or above the MCID following the addition of one active treatment to another, the concept of a â€œminimum worthwhile incremental advantageâ€ù has been proposed [33]."
PMC4213545,S239,,"In light of the caveats inherent in combination versus monotherapy trials, as well as the recognition that patients may experience advantages with combination therapy that are not readily measurable by certain outcome criteria, it is reasonable to conclude that the improvements in lung function and symptoms observed with the aclidinium/formoterol FDCs over each monotherapy in this trial may have clinical benefits for the moderate to severe COPD patient."
PMC4213545,S240,,"Due to the circadian nature of cholinergic tone, more impaired lung function is observed in the evening versus daytime in patients with COPD [35]."
PMC4213545,S241,,"This in turn may be related to the prevalence of sleep disturbance in a majority of patients with COPD [36,37], as well as reports of nighttime and early morning being the worst times of day for COPD patients due to breathlessness and other symptoms [38]."
PMC4213545,S242,,"Twice-daily aclidinium has been shown to significantly improve lung function at night compared with once-daily tiotropium [8], while other twice-daily COPD medications, including formoterol, reportedly improve nighttime symptoms [39-42]."
PMC4213545,S243,,"In the trial reported here, aclidinium/formoterol FDCs significantly reduced both nighttime and early morning symptoms compared with placeboâ€”measured by the newly developed NiSCI and EMSCI patient reported outcome measuresâ€”while treatment with the monotherapy components generally did not reach statistical significance in these outcomes."
PMC4213545,S244,,The disparity between nighttime symptoms outcomes with aclidinium monotherapy in this trial with those in a previously conducted study [43] could be due to the manner in which nighttime symptoms were evaluated as both the NiSCI and the EMSCI are currently undergoing empirical testing.
PMC4213545,S245,,"As the current study demonstrated that aclidinium/formoterol administered in the morning significantly improves bronchodilation as rapidly as 5Â minutes postdose, the evening dose of this twice-daily treatment may also alleviate impaired airflow at night and reduce breathlessness, potentially providing the added benefit of improving COPD symptoms when they are at their worst."
PMC4213545,S246,,Further analyses are necessary to correlate the clinically meaningful treatment effect of the aclidinium/formoterol FDCs on lung function with the positive effects on COPD symptoms.
PMC4213545,S247,,Conclusions
PMC4213545,S248,,The spirometric and clinical outcomes from this study demonstrate the sustained and improved efficacy of a fixed-dose combination of aclidinium 400Â Î_g/formoterol 12Â Î_g over its monotherapy components.
PMC4213545,S249,,"With a safety profile generally similar to the aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies, the results reported here support the use of an aclidinium/formoterol FDC as maintenance treatment for patients with moderate to severe COPD."

PMC4215282,S4,,Objective
PMC4215282,S5,,"This double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding phase IIb study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponesimod, an oral selective S1P1 receptor modulator, for the treatment of patients with relapsingâ€“remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)."
PMC4215282,S6,,Methods
PMC4215282,S7,,"464 patients were randomised to receive once-daily oral ponesimod 10, 20 or 40â€…mg, or placebo for 24â€…weeks."
PMC4215282,S8,,The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of new T1 gadolinium-enhanced (T1 Gd+) lesions per patient recorded every 4â€…weeks from weeks 12 to 24 after study drug initiation.
PMC4215282,S9,,Secondary endpoints were the annualised confirmed relapse rate (ARR) and time to first confirmed relapse.
PMC4215282,S10,,Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.
PMC4215282,S11,,Results
PMC4215282,S12,,"The mean cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions at weeks 12â€“24 was significantly lower in the ponesimod 10â€…mg (3.5; rate ratio (RR) 0.57; p=0.0318), 20â€…mg (1.1; RR 0.17; p<0.0001) and 40â€…mg (1.4; RR 0.23; p<0.0001) groups compared with placebo (6.2)."
PMC4215282,S13,,"The mean ARR was lower with 40â€…mg ponesimod versus placebo, with a maximum reduction of 52% (0.25 vs 0.53; p=0.0363)."
PMC4215282,S14,,The time to first confirmed relapse was increased with ponesimod compared with placebo.
PMC4215282,S15,,The proportion of patients with â‰¥1 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was similar across ponesimod groups and the placebo group.
PMC4215282,S16,,"Frequently reported AEs with higher incidence in the three ponesimod groups compared with placebo were anxiety, dizziness, dyspnoea, increased alanine aminotransferase, influenza, insomnia and peripheral oedema."

PMC4215282,S22,,Introduction
PMC4215282,S23,,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide.1 2
PMC4215282,S24,,Disease-modifying drugs for its treatment aim to reduce the relapse rate and slow the progression of disability.
PMC4215282,S25,,"These include interferon Î_, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab and natalizumab."
PMC4215282,S26,,"However, due to the complex interplay of efficacy and safety, the more efficacious therapies may be reserved for disease states sufficiently aggressive to justify the associated toxicity.1"
PMC4215282,S27,,"Furthermore, some available treatments, such as glatiramer acetate, require long-term self-injection by the patient, which may lead to a reduction in treatment adherence and, consequently, suboptimal efficacy.3"
PMC4215282,S28,,New therapies should have improved safety and efficacy and reduce the burden on the patient.
PMC4215282,S29,,"Hence, there has been a trend towards the development of oral therapies."
PMC4215282,S30,,"Recently approved therapies include fingolimod, which modulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, including S1P1, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5; teriflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, and dimethyl fumarate, which were first approved in 2010, 2012 and 2013, respectively.4â€“8"
PMC4215282,S31,,"Ponesimod [(Z,Z)-5-[3-chloro-4-((2R)-2,3-dihydroxy-propoxy)-benzylidene]-2-propylimino-3-o-tolyl-thiazolidin-4-one], an iminothiazolidinone derivative, is a reversible, orally active, selective S1P1 receptor modulator.9 10"
PMC4215282,S32,,"Unlike fingolimod, which is a structural analogue of sphingosine, ponesimod is selective for S1P1; In vitro, ponesimod is at least 10-fold more potent on the S1P1 receptor than on any other S1P receptor subtype.10"
PMC4215282,S33,,Lymphocyte exit from lymph nodes and their migration into the blood and target tissues is mediated by S1P binding to S1P1 receptors.
PMC4215282,S34,,"Binding of ponesimod to the S1P1 receptor results in rapid and efficient receptor internalisation, degradation and functional antagonism,10 11 thereby causing lymphocyte sequestration in the lymph nodes."
PMC4215282,S35,,"Phase I studies demonstrated that ponesimod pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional and characterised by low variability,12 and circulating lymphocyte counts are reduced in a dose-dependent manner.12 13"
PMC4215282,S36,,"Ponesimod has a rapid onset of action, with maximal plasma concentrations observed 2.5â€“4â€…h after dosing,13 14 and maximum lymphocyte count reduction achieved 6â€…h after dosing.12 14"

PMC4215282,S178,,"Once-daily treatment with ponesimod 10, 20 or 40â€…mg for 24â€…weeks significantly and dose-dependently reduced the cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions in patients with RRMS compared with placebo."
PMC4215282,S179,,These findings were corroborated by observed reductions in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions and the number of CUALs with ponesimod treatment compared with placebo.
PMC4215282,S180,,Treatment with ponesimod was also associated with a lower ARR and an increase in the time to first confirmed relapse.
PMC4215282,S181,,"A clear doseâ€“response relationship was observed for the primary endpoint; a similar doseâ€“response relationship has also been reported for another S1P receptor modulator in development, siponimod.22"
PMC4215282,S182,,"Although it is difficult to draw direct comparisons due to differences in study design, when compared with the phase II data from other available oral therapies for RRMS, ponesimod generally produced results that were of a similar magnitude."
PMC4215282,S183,,"With regards to the primary endpoint of this study (the mean cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions at weeks 12â€“24), ponesimod was comparable with dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod and teriflunomide.18 19 23"
PMC4215282,S184,,"The magnitude of the treatment effect with ponesimod was also similar for other study endpoints, including ARR.18 19 23"
PMC4215282,S185,,Ponesimod was generally well tolerated at doses of 10 and 20â€…mg; the 40â€…mg dose showed signs of reduced tolerability with no additional benefit with respect to MRI or pharmacodynamic efficacy compared with the 20â€…mg dose.
PMC4215282,S186,,"The reason for the lack of additional benefit with ponesimod 40â€…mg compared with ponesimod 20â€…mg is not entirely clear, although a lower mean T2 lesion volume at baseline as compared with other treatment groups may partly account for the fall-off in efficacy with regards to new or enlarging non-enhancing T2 lesions."
PMC4215282,S187,,"Ponesimod was associated with first-dose cardiac effects, similarly to other S1P receptor modulators such as fingolimod5 18 and siponimod22; with ponesimod, heart rate reduction reaches a maximum at 2â€“3â€…h after first dose and normalises approximately 6â€…h postdose, earlier than observed with fingolimod therapy.18"
PMC4215282,S188,,The up-titration dosing scheme was used to reduce the first-dose cardiac effects.
PMC4215282,S189,,"Consistent with ponesimod mode of action, lymphocyte counts were rapidly reduced upon treatment initiation, with the maximum effect established within 7â€“14â€…days for each dose level."
PMC4215282,S190,,"Importantly, no patients discontinued treatment due to lymphopenia, and the decrease in lymphocyte count was not associated with an increased risk of infections."
PMC4215282,S191,,"As shown in preclinical9 10 and phase I studies,12 13 ponesimod-associated lymphocyte sequestration was rapidly reversed upon treatment discontinuation, reaching levels close to baseline within 1â€…week."
PMC4215282,S192,,"By comparison, lymphocyte counts return to normal range within 1â€“2â€…months of stopping therapy with fingolimod.24"
PMC4215282,S193,,"The difference in lymphocyte recovery between the two compounds may be attributed to their pharmacokinetic profiles; while ponesimod has a terminal half-life of approximately 32â€…h,13 14 the terminal half-life of fingolimod is approximately 8â€…days.25"
PMC4215282,S194,,"Although no documented cases have yet been reported to suggest that the long half-life of fingolimod has been problematic, rapid drug elimination and effect reversibility may be of clinical benefit in cases of serious infection, vaccination and pregnancy."
PMC4215282,S195,,"Furthermore, fingolimod undergoes a phosphorylationâ€“dephosphorylation cycle in vivo, which is required for its activation/deactivation26; this step is not required for ponesimod and may contribute to its low pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability."
PMC4215282,S196,,"Additionally, ponesimod is highly selective for the S1P1 receptor,10 while fingolimod is active on the S1P1 and S1P3â€“5 receptors.26"
PMC4215282,S197,,The clinical significance of this selectivity is not yet clear.
PMC4215282,S198,,"Concerns surrounding non-selectivity primarily revolve around safety, particularly with regards to cardiac effects."
PMC4215282,S199,,"At least three S1P receptors (S1P1â€“3) are present in the heart and vasculature, and the predominantly expressed receptor subtype varies with cell type."
PMC4215282,S200,,"Specific S1P receptor subtypes may also mediate specific cardiac effects, such as hypertension and bradycardia.27"
PMC4215282,S201,,"Notably, activation of the S1P3 receptor results in bradycardia in both mice and humans.28"
PMC4215282,S202,,"Nevertheless, first-dose effects and decreased heart rate have been observed with ponesimod and fingolimod."
PMC4215282,S203,,Further investigation and long-term studies are needed to define the importance of receptor selectivity with regards to cardiac function.
PMC4215282,S204,,"There are other effects arising from S1P receptor selectivity that deserve further investigation; evidence from in vitro studies suggests that fingolimod may have pro-fibrotic effects due to the stimulation of the S1P3 receptor, an effect that is not replicated with ponesimod.29 30"
PMC4215282,S205,,"On the other hand, modulation of S1P3 and S1P5, in addition to S1P1, may enhance remyelination, which is critical in restoring electrical impulse conduction and preventing further degeneration or injury.31"
PMC4215282,S206,,"The 24-week treatment duration of this study, although sufficient to establish the doseâ€“response effect on MRI parameters, limits the provision of long-term safety and clinical efficacy data."
PMC4215282,S207,,"To consolidate the observations reported in this study, an extension study of up to 5â€…yearsâ€™ duration is ongoing."

PMC4392313,S2,,"Effect of interleukin-6 receptor blockade on surrogates of vascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis: MEASURE, a randomised, placebo-controlled study"
PMC4392313,S3,,Abstract
PMC4392313,S4,,Objectives
PMC4392313,S5,,The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker tocilizumab (TCZ) reduces inflammatory disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but elevates lipid concentrations in some patients.
PMC4392313,S6,,We aimed to characterise the impact of IL-6R inhibition on established and novel risk factors in active RA.
PMC4392313,S7,,Methods
PMC4392313,S8,,"Randomised, multicentre, two-part, phase III trial (24-week double-blind, 80-week open-label), MEASURE, evaluated lipid and lipoprotein levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle composition, markers of coagulation, thrombosis and vascular function by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 132 patients with RA who received TCZ or placebo."
PMC4392313,S9,,Results
PMC4392313,S10,,"Median total-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels increased in TCZ versus placebo recipients by week 12 (12.6% vs 1.7%, 28.1% vs 2.2%, 10.6% vs âˆ’1.9%, respectively; all p<0.01)."
PMC4392313,S11,,"There were no significant differences in mean small LDL, mean oxidised LDL or total HDL-C concentrations."
PMC4392313,S12,,"However, HDL-associated serum amyloid A content decreased in TCZ recipients."
PMC4392313,S13,,"TCZ also induced reductions (>30%) in secretory phospholipase A2-IIA, lipoprotein(a), fibrinogen and D-dimers and elevation of paraoxonase (all p<0.0001 vs placebo)."
PMC4392313,S14,,The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio remained stable over time in both groups.
PMC4392313,S15,,PWV decreases were greater with placebo than TCZ at 12â€…weeks (adjusted mean difference 0.79â€…m/s (95% CI 0.22 to 1.35; p=0.0067)).
PMC4392313,S16,,Conclusions
PMC4392313,S17,,These data provide the first detailed evidence for the modulation of lipoprotein particles and other surrogates of vascular risk with IL-6R inhibition.
PMC4392313,S18,,"When compared with placebo, TCZ induced elevations in LDL-C but altered HDL particles towards an anti-inflammatory composition and favourably modified most, but not all, measured vascular risk surrogates."
PMC4392313,S19,,The net effect of such changes for cardiovascular risk requires determination.
PMC4392313,S20,,Introduction
PMC4392313,S21,,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with clinically important comorbidities, including accelerated cardiovascular risk.1"
PMC4392313,S22,,"The latter is not explained by conventional risk factors (eg, hypertension, obesity), suggesting that additional pathways contribute to adverse outcomes."
PMC4392313,S23,,"These may reflect common genetic or environmental aetiological factors or the impact of chronic inflammation on underlying atherosclerotic disease burden, operating through circulating cytokines, immune complexes, complement factors and acute-phase reactants.2â€“4"
PMC4392313,S24,,"Furthermore, it is recognised that absolute circulating lipid concentrations are modified in RA, likely reflecting regulatory integration of metabolic and inflammatory molecular networks.5"
PMC4392313,S25,,"In general, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are reduced in active disease6 and may increase on the initiation of effective therapeutics regardless of modality.7"
PMC4392313,S26,,"Moreover, interpretation of lipid particle concentrations may be further complicated by changes in size and composition associated with inflammation."
PMC4392313,S27,,"For example, small LDL-C particles may confer more atherogenic risk than larger LDL-C particles.8"
PMC4392313,S28,,"In inflammatory conditions, HDL particles are associated with increased serum amyloid A (SAA) content, representing a potentially proatherogenic phenotype.9"
PMC4392313,S29,,The impact of therapy on subparticle components in RA has not been well characterised.
PMC4392313,S30,,"Similarly, the effect of therapy on other lipid particles causally associated with vascular disease, such as lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]),10 and on clotting factors, such as fibrinogen or markers of activated clotting such as D-dimer,11 is poorly understood."
PMC4392313,S31,,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in various inflammatory effector pathways in RA through B-cell, fibroblast and osteoclast activation."

PMC4392313,S33,,"Intriguingly, elevated IL-6 levels are independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including fatal myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident, in the general population.13 14"
PMC4392313,S34,,"The mechanisms mediating such epidemiological observations are poorly understood but are likely to be commensurate with the fundamental role played by inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the systemic functional activities of IL-6 conferred by widespread gp130 receptor membrane expression and the existence of soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R).15"
PMC4392313,S35,,"Moreover, loss-of-function IL-6R polymorphisms are associated with reduced vascular risk.16 17"
PMC4392313,S36,,Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6R (membrane-bound and soluble) that reduces inflammation and articular damage in patients with RA.
PMC4392313,S37,,"In phase II and III trials, moderate elevations of LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides were apparent in RA patients treated with TCZ.7"
PMC4392313,S38,,The atherogenic implications of these changes are unknown.
PMC4392313,S39,,"Similarly, the effect of IL-6R blockade on vascular physiology parameters (eg, as assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV)) has been minimally explored."
PMC4392313,S40,,PWV is a measure of early structural vascular changes and has been shown to respond within 3â€…months to changes in vascular inflammation.18
PMC4392313,S41,,"Thus, given its mode of action, TCZ provides a highly specific molecular intervention with which to dissect the role of IL-6 in the modulation of lipid particles and the regulation of other vascular risk factors in patients with chronic inflammation."
PMC4392313,S42,,We report herein the results of a placebo-controlled trial that sought to define the effects of TCZ on a range of vascular risk surrogates in patients with RA.
PMC4392313,S43,,Our primary hypotheses were that PWV and small LDL particles would be significantly reduced by TCZ.

PMC4392313,S96,,"One patient in each arm withdrew because of an adverse event; one patient on placebo withdrew because of insufficient therapeutic response, three patients in the TCZ arm refused treatment and one patient in the TCZ arm was withdrawn because of a protocol violation."
PMC4392313,S97,,"Two patients in the TCZ arm had their lipid-lowering medications changed; though included in the ITT analyses, they were excluded from the per-protocol analyses."
PMC4392313,S98,,"Of 124 patients who completed blinded treatment, 117 elected to continue to the open-label phase; 92 completed treatment for 96â€…weeks."
PMC4392313,S99,,Demographic and baseline disease characteristics (table 1) were similar to those of the TCZ phase III cohort.20
PMC4392313,S100,,"Moreover, 30% and 39% of the patients in the placebo and TCZ arms, respectively, had previously received aTNFs."
PMC4392313,S101,,"TCZ efficacy, assessed by change in disease activity score at 28 joints (DAS28) at weeks 12 and 24 or by ACR 20/50/70 proportional changes at week 24, was similar to that previously observed and differed significantly from that of placebo (see online supplementary figure S1)."

PMC4392313,S136,,Discussion
PMC4392313,S137,,"We herein tested the primary hypotheses that TCZ in comparison to placebo would significantly lower PWV and the amount of small, dense LDL."
PMC4392313,S138,,"However, neither hypothesis was supported."
PMC4392313,S139,,"There was no change in the amount of small, dense LDL, and though PWV declined in both groups it did so more in placebo recipients."
PMC4392313,S140,,We also performed extensive additional analyses to investigate the wider impact of IL-6R inhibition on a range of vascular risk factors.
PMC4392313,S141,,"Thus, we report that TCZ did modulate lipid particle levels (LDL, HDL, VLDL) and composition (HDL-associated SAA), together with a number of other inflammatory (CRP, paraoxonase) and vascular (Lp(a), D-dimer, fibrinogen) risk factors, suggesting potential modulation of the net atherogenic risk profile."
PMC4392313,S142,,"Consistent with results from other TCZ phase III clinical trials, total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride levels increased in TCZ-treated patients but were minimally changed in placebo patients."
PMC4392313,S143,,"In contrast, small LDL particle concentrations, considered proatherogenic, remained similar in TCZ-treated and placebo patients."
PMC4392313,S144,,"Moreover, we observed a decrease (>30%) in Lp(a), a risk factor independently associated with vascular events.10"
PMC4392313,S145,,"NMR assessment of lipoprotein subclasses revealed clear and sizeable changes in all classes of VLDL particles, the functional significance of which is yet unclear."
PMC4392313,S146,,"By contrast, we did not see a reduction in PWV with TCZ but rather a significant reduction in the placebo group at 12â€…weeks relative to TCZ recipients, though this pattern was not sustained to the 24-week measurement."
PMC4392313,S147,,"This finding, therefore, contradicts our original hypothesis."
PMC4392313,S148,,"It should be noted, however, that technical challenges during the conduct of this multicentre trial led to approximately 15% of the measurements being substandard."
PMC4392313,S149,,"Because of the severity of disease in study participants who had reduced mobility, contractures and joint pain, the procedure proved more difficult than anticipated."
PMC4392313,S150,,"Nevertheless, it appears that PWV is not necessarily reduced with TCZ, though further studies with other vascular function measures not influenced by limited mobility (eg, peripheral arterial tonometry as a measure of endothelial function) would be useful."
PMC4392313,S151,,"Our findings contrast with those of Kume et al,21 who observed similar reductions in cardio-ankle vascular index and aortic augmentation index for patients treated with TCZ, adalimumab or etanercept."
PMC4392313,S152,,"Speculatively, it remains possible that disease-related vascular changes in patients in the present study (in which mean DAS28 was high) were much more progressed (and, thus, less reversible) than in patients studied in other trials.18 21"
PMC4392313,S153,,"Increases in HDL particle number, measured by NMR, occurred primarily in small particles."
PMC4392313,S154,,Our demonstration of a significant increase in the concentration of small HDL particles with TCZ treatment is consistent with a potential â€˜normalisationâ€™ of small HDL particle levels.
PMC4392313,S155,,"Small HDL particle numbers, measured by NMR, in two independent studies were lower in RA patients than in controls despite similar HDL-C concentrations.5 6"
PMC4392313,S156,,"Furthermore, the observed significant reduction in medium HDL and HDL-SAA concentrations, along with the increase in paraoxonase, an antioxidant enzyme associated with HDL, suggests remodelling of HDL particles from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to TCZ treatment."
PMC4392313,S157,,"Overall, such changes in HDL particle composition with TCZ are consistent with the results of a recent study of aTNFs in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.22"
PMC4392313,S158,,"Although it is unclear to what extent small HDL particles measured by NMR corroborate with those measured by other methods, small HDL particles may be more active in cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory functions,23 though this observation remains debated."
PMC4392313,S159,,Previous studies have demonstrated lower levels of LDL-C in patients with active RA than in controls.6
PMC4392313,S160,,"Such decreases may result from increased catabolism (including by scavenger receptors), increased particle retention in tissue, or both, rather than from decreased lipid production."
PMC4392313,S161,,"Increased cholesterol retention under conditions of elevated IL-6/IL-6R levels have been hypothesised to result from increased surface density on multiple tissues of LDL receptor, VLDL receptor and scavenger receptors, leading to excess internalisation of VLDL and LDL.24â€“26"
PMC4392313,S162,,"Furthermore, sPLA2-IIA expression, augmented by IL-6, leads to phospholipid hydrolysis of LDL and increases LDL uptake in tissues.27"
PMC4392313,S163,,"Consistent with our results and the TCZ phase III programme,7 the TCZ-based IL-6 signal inhibition may reduce various receptor surface levels and sPLA2-IIA levels, leading to both decreased LDL and VLDL tissue retention and elevated circulating levels."
PMC4392313,S164,,Decreased thrombotic potential in TCZ-treated RA patients is indicated by declines in circulating fibrinogen and D-dimer levels.
PMC4392313,S165,,"Although the reduction in fibrinogen, an acute-phase protein, with TCZ is predictable, the reduction of D-dimer is of particular interest because it represents the most widely used clinical marker of activated blood coagulation."
PMC4392313,S166,,"Moreover, several prospective studies28 29 have linked elevated D-dimer levels to heightened risk for vascular events independently of established risk factors."
PMC4392313,S167,,"Similarly, the sizeable reduction in Lp(a) observed with TCZ is of considerable interest because recent genetic and epidemiological evidence suggests Lp(a) is causally linked to cardiovascular events in the general population.10 30"
PMC4392313,S168,,"Our Lp(a) observations also extend findings from an earlier randomised, placebo-controlled study linking aTNF blockade to dose-dependent reductions in Lp(a) in patients with psoriatic arthritis.31"
PMC4392313,S169,,"Collectively, these changes suggest a reduction in thrombotic potential with TCZ in patients with active RA."
PMC4392313,S170,,"Of course, the net effect of TCZ-induced changes to vascular outcomes can be robustly tested only in the context of vascular outcomes in prospective studies."
PMC4392313,S171,,"In summary, the results of this randomised, placebo-controlled study suggest that IL-6R blockade with TCZ in patients with active RA not only reduces markers of inflammation but also affects quantitative and qualitative changes in lipids and lipoproteins."
PMC4392313,S172,,"Such changes include a global increase in LDL-C concentration, in line with findings from other biological studies,7 and apparently favourable changes to HDL particle composition, rendering them less pro-inflammatory."
PMC4392313,S173,,"In addition, marked reductions in haemostatic and Lp(a) markers were observed, though PWV did not change favourably."
PMC4392313,S174,,"Future determination of the net vascular effect of such changes in RA patientsâ€”and potentially other groups of patientsâ€” is of major interest, particularly given the recent data from large-scale (>130â€…000 subjects, >25â€…000 coronary heart disease cases) genome-wide association studies16 17 that suggest a potentially detrimental effect of IL-6R signalling on the risk for coronary heart disease."

PMC4431679,S8,,"Patients with left sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia were excluded."
PMC4431679,S9,,Interventions Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin 1 g twice daily for a minimum of seven days and then by indication.
PMC4431679,S10,,"Main outcome measures The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure assessed at day 7, consisting of death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of bacteraemia."
PMC4431679,S11,,The primary safety outcome was all cause mortality at day 30.
PMC4431679,S12,,Non-inferiority was defined by a difference of less than 15% for treatment failure.
PMC4431679,S13,,"Results 252 patients were included in the trial, of whom 91 (36%) had bacteraemia."
PMC4431679,S14,,"No significant difference in treatment failure was seen for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (51/135, 38%) versus vancomycin (32/117, 27%)â€”risk ratio 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99)."

PMC4431679,S23,,Introduction
PMC4431679,S24,,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an old antibiotic active against Staphylococcus aureus.
PMC4431679,S25,,"Trimethoprim is the main active component and bactericidal in itself, but the combination is highly synergistic.1"
PMC4431679,S26,,"With increasing rates of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in healthcare settings and in the community, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been suggested as a convenient treatment option.2 3 4"
PMC4431679,S27,,MRSA isolates have retained susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in many locations worldwide despite several decades of exposure to the antibiotic.
PMC4431679,S28,,"Coverage rates above 90% are described in contemporary reports for community associated MRSA and nosocomial isolates in the United States,5 6 7 8 Canada,9 10 11 Japan,12, Europe, Israel, and Turkey.13 14 15"
PMC4431679,S29,,"Resistance is described in Australia, where 30% of nosocomial and 10% of community associated MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2012, but a significant trend for decreasing resistance from 2005 was observed, unlike other antibiotics.16 17"
PMC4431679,S30,,"In sub-Saharan Africa, 19% resistance has been recently documented, owing to high rates of trimethoprim resistance.18"
PMC4431679,S31,,"In India, more than 85% of MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between 2009 and 2011.19 20"
PMC4431679,S32,,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections but not for MRSA bacteraemia or pneumonia.21
PMC4431679,S33,,Vancomycin is the primary treatment recommendation for these infections.
PMC4431679,S34,,"Alternatives to vancomycin are sought as vancomycin is inferior to Î_ lactams in meticillin susceptible S aureus infections,22 23 and it may be less effective against MRSA at the higher end of the vancomycin susceptible range.24"
PMC4431679,S35,,"In a small observational study, we reported similar outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia.25"
PMC4431679,S36,,Favourable outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin were reported in an observational study focusing on infections caused by MRSA with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 Î_g/mL to vancomycin.8
PMC4431679,S37,,"In both studies, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given to significantly less ill patients."

PMC4431679,S118,,Discussion
PMC4431679,S119,,"In a randomised controlled trial including 252 patients with severe MRSA infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not fulfil criteria for non-inferiority to vancomycin."
PMC4431679,S120,,"The absolute difference in treatment failure rates at day 7â€”comprising death, clinical/haemodynamic instability, and persistence of bacteraemiaâ€”was 10.4% (âˆ’1.2% to 21.5%) in favour of vancomycin, crossing the upper limit of 15% difference defined for non-inferiority."
PMC4431679,S121,,"After adjustment for differences between groups, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly associated with treatment failure (odds ratio 2.00, 1.09 to 3.65)."
PMC4431679,S122,,"Thirty day mortality did not differ significantly between groups (risk ratio 1.27, 0.65 to 2.45); however, among patients with bacteraemia (n=91), death rates were non-significantly higher with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."
PMC4431679,S123,,Results were similar in a per protocol analysis.
PMC4431679,S124,,Bacteriological cure and adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.
PMC4431679,S125,,"Our trial was pragmatic, targeting all patients treated with vancomycin in clinical practice."
PMC4431679,S126,,We defined no exclusion criteria related to severity of background illness or sepsis.
PMC4431679,S127,,Exclusions were based only on contraindications for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (such as chronic haemodialysis) or previous evidence suggesting inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
PMC4431679,S128,,We thus excluded left sided endocarditis owing to an in vivo study of endocarditis in rabbits showing lower survival and vegetation sterilisation and higher bacterial load on vegetations with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin and other antibiotics.32
PMC4431679,S129,,"We excluded patients with MRSA meningitis owing to inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to nafcillin in an experimental model of meticillin susceptible S aureus meningitis and lack of evidence in MRSA, despite good penetration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to the brain.33 34"
PMC4431679,S130,,"We originally intended to recruit patients with non-microbiologically documented, highly probable MRSA infections."
PMC4431679,S131,,"However, in practice, we found identifying such patients prospectively difficult and practically the trial included only patients with microbiologically confirmed MRSA infections."
PMC4431679,S132,,The main reason precluding inclusion of patients was inability to obtain informed consent at the time of acute sepsis.
PMC4431679,S133,,"In Israel, regulations allow only legal guardians to replace patientsâ€™ informed consent (informed consent from relatives is not allowed), and with acute conditions most patients did not have an appointed legal guardian."
PMC4431679,S134,,Comparison with other studies
PMC4431679,S135,,Few randomised controlled trials have assessed the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of staphylococcal infections.
PMC4431679,S136,,A single randomised controlled trial compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against vancomycin for staphylococcal infections.23
PMC4431679,S137,,The trial randomised 228 intravenous drug users with suspected staphylococcal infections and analysed 101 with proven infections (54 with meticillin susceptible S aureus and 47 with MRSA).
PMC4431679,S138,,"Vancomycin was superior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among patients with meticillin susceptible S aureus infections, but no differences were observed for patients with MRSA."
PMC4431679,S139,,"Specifically, bacteraemia duration (total 57 patients) was longer with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for meticillin susceptible S aureus (7.8 v 3.5 days; P=0.05) and similar for MRSA (5.2 v 5.6 days)."
PMC4431679,S140,,"The authors concluded that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a valuable alternative for the treatment of MRSA infections, unlike the conclusions of our study."
PMC4431679,S141,,"However, the study included significantly younger and less ill patients, with a single death compared with the 13% mortality rate in our study."
PMC4431679,S142,,"In a recent randomised controlled trial, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampin was compared with linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infections (bacteraemia in 18/150 (12%) and mortality in 14/150 (9%)), showing no differences in failure/relapse rates or mortality.15"
PMC4431679,S143,,"Among 50 patients with chronic meticillin susceptible S aureus osteomyelitis randomised to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin versus oxacillin, long term outcomes were similar and patients allocated to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin had a significantly shorter hospital stay (median 51 v 31 days).35"
PMC4431679,S144,,"Finally, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not significantly different from doxycycline for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in a small randomised controlled trial assessing 22 patients with MRSA.36"
PMC4431679,S145,,"The main treatment options for MRSA infections other than vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline.37"
PMC4431679,S146,,Most of the new antibiotics were evaluated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials.
PMC4431679,S147,,Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials and when reported was very low (usually <1%).
PMC4431679,S148,,"Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not include only MRSA."
PMC4431679,S149,,"Daptomycin was non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial including 245 patients with S aureus bacteraemia, of whom 89 had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin.38"
PMC4431679,S150,,The overall mortality was 11%.
PMC4431679,S151,,"Similar efficacy and safety for was shown for linezolid and vancomycin in nosocomial pneumonia, and the mortality rate in these trials was 14%.39"
PMC4431679,S152,,"Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial including 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections, but most were skin and soft tissue infections (mortality rate 5%).40"
PMC4431679,S153,,"Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA, overall mortality in the study 19%).41"
PMC4431679,S154,,"Compared with these trials, ours included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as evidenced by the mortality rates, more closely reflecting patients treated with MRSA infections in clinical practice."
PMC4431679,S155,,Limitations of study
PMC4431679,S156,,"The main limitation of our trial is the small sample size of patients with bacteraemia, in whom results suggest an important advantage for vancomycin."
PMC4431679,S157,,No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline for nearly all variables.
PMC4431679,S158,,"However, a subtle difference existed for important prognostic variables, and more patients allocated to vancomycin were bacteraemic."
PMC4431679,S159,,"Multivariable analysis of the entire study cohort showed a larger advantage of vancomycin with regard to treatment failure, reaching statistical significance."
PMC4431679,S160,,"Patients with polymicrobial infections and receiving additional antibiotics were included in the study, reflecting its pragmatic nature."
PMC4431679,S161,,"However, these were mostly inactive against MRSA and concomitant antibiotics covering MRSA were not allowed at randomisation."
PMC4431679,S162,,"Patients excluded owing to inability to provide informed consent had higher severity of illness scores than those included, affecting the trialâ€™s external validity."
PMC4431679,S163,,"Finally, the dosing of vancomycin and trough levels achieved (â‰¥15 Âµg/mL in only 67% of patients) were lower than currently recommended,20 potentially resulting in an underestimation of the efficacy of vancomycin and the difference between arms."
PMC4431679,S164,,Conclusion
PMC4431679,S165,,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority compared with vancomycin among patients with invasive MRSA infections.
PMC4431679,S166,,"In the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia, the difference in treatment failure and all cause mortality might be clinically important."
PMC4431679,S167,,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for the treatment of severe MRSA infections.
PMC4431679,S168,,"We propose a further randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of step-down from vancomycin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allowing early discharge of patients with MRSA responding to treatment."
PMC4431679,S169,,What is already known on this topic
PMC4431679,S170,,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has excellent coverage against meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in most locations worldwide
PMC4431679,S171,,Vancomycin is inferior to Î_ lactams for meticillin susceptible S aureus and might be losing effectiveness against MRSA owing to minimum inhibitory concentration â€œcreepâ€ù
PMC4431679,S172,,No contemporary randomised controlled trials have compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections

PMC4469977,S23,,Introduction
PMC4469977,S24,,Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory disorder that causes progressive necrotising ulceration.
PMC4469977,S25,,A retrospective cohort study of UK cases reported an age and sex adjusted incidence of 0.63 per 100â€‰000 person years.1
PMC4469977,S26,,"Several variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been recognised, but the classic form of the disease is the most commonly encountered.2"
PMC4469977,S27,,"Manifestations of pyoderma gangrenosum are predominantly cutaneous, typically beginning as a tender erythematous nodule or pustule that rapidly breaks down to form a large, well demarcated ulcer with purplish, undermined edges."
PMC4469977,S28,,"The condition is often observed in patients with an underlying systemic disease and has been particularly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and haematological malignancies.3"
PMC4469977,S29,,"Approximately 25% of cases are precipitated by incidental or iatrogenic trauma, a phenomenon known as pathergy.4 5 6 7"
PMC4469977,S30,,"The development of pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with a threefold increased risk of death (hazard ratio 3.03) compared with that of controls from the general population, and a 72% increased mortality over controls with inflammatory bowel disease.1"
PMC4469977,S31,,Currently there are no national or international guidelines covering the management of pyoderma gangrenosum.
PMC4469977,S32,,"Patient information issued by the British Association of Dermatologists describes topical and systemic treatment options, as well as lesser used options such as intravenous steroids or biologics.8"
PMC4469977,S33,,"The most commonly prescribed topical treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum are potent steroid preparations and calcineurin inhibitors, and commonly prescribed systemic treatments include steroids and immunosuppressants.8"
PMC4469977,S34,,Only one randomised controlled trial in patients with pyoderma gangrenosum is reported in the literature.9
PMC4469977,S35,,"This small, placebo controlled study of 30 patients assessed infliximab, which is not considered to be a first line treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum."
PMC4469977,S36,,"There is a complete lack of studies assessing the efficacy of commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, so systematic reviews have primarily relied on anecdotal reports or retrospective case series.10"
PMC4469977,S37,,"Given the complete absence of high quality evidence on treatments, we carried out a randomised controlled trial (STOP GAP, Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin is superior to prednisolone in the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum."

PMC4469977,S161,,"Notable differences included new onset diabetes and hyperglycaemia in the prednisolone group, and headaches, gastrointestinal disturbance, and renal dysfunction commonly in the ciclosporin group."
PMC4469977,S162,,Nine serious adverse reactions occurred: two in the ciclosporin group (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and acute kidney injury with increased serum creatinine (212 Âµmol/L) levels) and seven in the prednisolone group (a bowel perforation; five serious infections (one resulted in death) that required admission to hospital or parenteral antibiotics; and one other infection).
PMC4469977,S163,,Discussion
PMC4469977,S164,,"In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, no difference was found between the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, ciclosporin and prednisolone, across a range of outcome measures."
PMC4469977,S165,,"Contrary to the anecdotally derived belief that these drugs are efficacious in pyoderma gangrenosum, we found that fewer than half of the ulcers healed, even after prolonged treatment, and the speed of onset of response did not differ between the two treatments."
PMC4469977,S166,,Approximately two thirds of participants reported adverse reactions; 12% of whom experienced a serious event.
PMC4469977,S167,,The side effects observed were in line with the known side effect profiles of these drugs.
PMC4469977,S168,,"More serious adverse reactions, especially serious infections, were reported in the prednisolone group, although patients receiving ciclosporin were at increased risk of renal toxicity."
PMC4469977,S169,,"A recent expert consensus paper considering safety, efficacy, and cost placed prednisolone as preferred treatment and ciclosporin as second ranked treatment among the many suggested interventions for pyoderma gangrenosum.7"
PMC4469977,S170,,"None the less, previous studies have reported large proportions of people with pyoderma gangrenosum achieving complete response with ciclosporin,19 20 21 22 23 which led the current researchers of the STOP GAP (Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin was superior to prednisolone for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum."
PMC4469977,S171,,Healing responses at six weeks in our study were broadly similar to those observed for the randomised controlled trial of infliximab compared with placebo.9
PMC4469977,S172,,"In the STOP GAP trial, ulcers had healed at six weeks in 15% of participants in the ciclosporin group and 21% in the prednisolone group."
PMC4469977,S173,,"By comparison, ulcers had healed at six weeks in 21% of participants in the infliximab trial (all participants who had not responded to treatment at week 2 were offered infliximab regardless of the randomised allocation to infliximab or placebo).9"
PMC4469977,S174,,"Subsequent observational studies suggest that treatment with antitumour necrosis factor is potentially more effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,24 25 but we did not have the power to look at this in the current trial."
PMC4469977,S175,,"Head to head comparisons of antitumour necrosis factor with ciclosporin or prednisolone are needed, along with investigation of topical interventions that may provide a better risk-benefit profile for patients."
PMC4469977,S176,,"This trial is four times larger than the only other randomised controlled trial conducted in pyoderma gangrenosum, and it required national collaboration through the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network.26"
PMC4469977,S177,,"Patient recruitment from 39 UK hospitals ensured representative sampling; the protocol reflected normal clinical practice, with dosing adjusted according to clinical need; and outcomes included clinician assessed, patient assessed, and independent assessment of digital images."
PMC4469977,S178,,"Every effort was made to capture the primary outcome in a blinded fashion, and all secondary analyses were supportive of this main analysis, although power to explore the impact on quality of life was limited owing to missing data from postal questionnaires."
PMC4469977,S179,,"Given the lack of a placebo or no treatment third arm in this study, it is possible that neither drug is effective in treating pyoderma gangrenosum."
PMC4469977,S180,,"However, it was considered unethical to leave patients with a serious, potentially fatal disease, without treatment."
PMC4469977,S181,,"The obtained sample size was slightly smaller than had been planned, but the narrow confidence intervals for between group comparisons suggest that we did not miss clinically important differences."
PMC4469977,S182,,The trial was stopped after achieving 86% of target recruitment owing to time and financial limitations.
PMC4469977,S183,,This decision was made before the database was locked and data analysed.
PMC4469977,S184,,Conclusion
PMC4469977,S185,,"Patients who require systemic treatment are likely to respond similarly to prednisolone or ciclosporin in the short term, but neither treatment is especially effective when healing at six months is considered."
PMC4469977,S186,,Differences in side effect profiles should be taken into account when choosing treatments.
PMC4469977,S187,,Table 8 provides an outline of key comorbidities that clinicians may wish to consider when choosing between prednisolone and ciclosporin for individual patients.

PMC4469977,S190,,"However, our results suggest that better treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum are urgently needed."
PMC4469977,S191,,What is already known on this topic
PMC4469977,S192,,"Pyoderma gangrenosum is a severe, painful ulcerative skin condition that has a weak evidence base for treatments, with only one published randomised controlled trial of 30 participants"
PMC4469977,S193,,"Prednisolone has been the main systemic treatment, but many clinicians now use ciclosporin in the belief that it is more effective and has fewer side effects"
PMC4469977,S194,,"Both prednisolone and ciclosporin have important, predictable side effects"
PMC4469977,S195,,What this study adds
PMC4469977,S196,,"In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, ciclosporin and prednisolone were of similar efficacy, but only 50% of ulcers had healed by six months,"
PMC4469977,S197,,"Adverse events were common, occurring in around two thirds of participants taking either study drug suggesting that better treatments are required"

PMC4515982,S6,,Methods
PMC4515982,S7,,"Patients with probable laboratory-supported, probable or definite ALS were enrolled by 25 Italian centres and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous rhEPO 40â€…000â€…IU or placebo fortnightly as add-on treatment to riluzole 100â€…mg daily for 12â€…months."
PMC4515982,S8,,"The primary composite outcome was survival, tracheotomy or >23â€…h non-invasive ventilation (NIV)."

PMC4515982,S20,,RhEPO 40â€…000â€…IU fortnightly did not change the course of ALS.
PMC4515982,S21,,Introduction
PMC4515982,S22,,"Several in vitro and in vivo models of degenerative, toxic and inflammatory peripheral and central nervous system diseases have shown that erythropoietin (EPO) and its non-erythropoietic derivatives have neuroprotective properties.1"
PMC4515982,S23,,EPO is a circulating glycoprotein whose principal function is the production of red blood cells through the inhibition of erythroid progenitor apoptosis and regulation of differentiation in the bone marrow.
PMC4515982,S24,,"Endogenous EPO and the recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) form are identical regarding the sequence of amino acids, but have heterogeneous bioavailability and pharmacokinetics due to the different composition of the sugar side chains, indicated by a Greek letter suffix (eg, Î±, Î_, Î_ and Î´)."
PMC4515982,S25,,EPO and its classical receptor (EPOR) are expressed in human neurons and astrocytes.
PMC4515982,S26,,"Preclinical studies demonstrating that non-erythropoietic EPO derivatives could also be tissue protective2 suggested the existence of a further non-haematopoietic receptor (EPOR)2, shared by members of the interleukin-3 receptor family.3"
PMC4515982,S27,,"Nevertheless, studies in rodent models demonstrated that the expression of the classical EPOR was mandatory for EPO-induced neuroprotection.4"
PMC4515982,S28,,The hypothesis that EPO could specifically exert a protective effect on motor neurons arose from several lines of research.
PMC4515982,S29,,EPO was found to protect cultured motor neurons from serum-BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) deprivation or long-term kainate exposure.5
PMC4515982,S30,,"Treatment with EPO and non-erythropoietic derivatives improved motor performances and protected from motor neuron degeneration in the wobbler mouse model, although the effects were limited to women and survival was not prolonged.6"
PMC4515982,S31,,"In SOD1G93A mice, increased EPO and EPOR expression in the brain cortex was interpreted as a possible compensatory effect of altered neuronal function.7"
PMC4515982,S32,,"In the same model, EPO treatment delayed the onset of motor deterioration and protected thoracic spinal cord motor neurons from degeneration.8"
PMC4515982,S33,,"However, this effect could not be replicated.9"
PMC4515982,S34,,EPO was also found to reduce SOD1 aggregates in motor neurons.10
PMC4515982,S35,,"In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the cerebrospinal fluid EPO level was lower than in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, and its concentration was suggested to correlate with the progression of the disease.11"
PMC4515982,S36,,"Moreover, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of EPO and vascular endothelial growth factor were found to be significantly higher and lower, respectively, in hypoxaemic patients with ALS, suggesting an intact common oxygen-sensor pathway.12"
PMC4515982,S37,,"On the basis of the results of our previous pilot study,13 we designed a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial to assess the efficacy of rhEPO as an add-on treatment in patients with sporadic ALS."

PMC4515982,S137,,Discussion
PMC4515982,S138,,Several studies suggested that EPO can promote the homeostasis of cells under stress and exert protective actions on different tissues.
PMC4515982,S139,,"Peripheral administration allows EPO to penetrate through an intact blood-brain-barrier,15â€“17 and this has been exploited to test its neurotrophic effects in multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.18 19"
PMC4515982,S140,,"Encouraging preclinical studies with EPO and its non-erythropoietic derivatives in models of central and peripheral nervous system degenerative diseases,2 expression of the non-erythropoietic receptor (EPOR)2 in motor neurons6 and preliminary data from ALS mouse models8 and a pilot clinical trial13 suggested that patients with ALS might benefit from rhEPO treatment."
PMC4515982,S141,,"Conversely, our study demonstrated that rhEPO administered at the dose of 40â€…000â€…IU fortnightly did not change either survival or disability at 12â€…months."
PMC4515982,S142,,"Patientsâ€™ demographic and clinical features were well balanced between the treatment arms, supporting the reliability of the results."
PMC4515982,S143,,"The significant and stable increase of haemoglobin and haematocrit values in the rhEPO group throughout the entire treatment period demonstrated that rhEPO exerted its expected haematological effects, and therefore it was not degraded in patients with ALS."
PMC4515982,S144,,"This observation strengthens our negative findings, suggesting that the lack of neuroprotective effect could not be attributed to an altered biological activity of rhEPO at the haematological level."
PMC4515982,S145,,Our negative findings appear to be in keeping with those disappointing from previous clinical studies investigating rhEPO neuroprotection in critical illness and patients with stroke.1
PMC4515982,S146,,"RhEPO may remain a promising treatment in schizophrenia19 and in the prevention of cognitive impairment after cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass,20 though these preliminary data need larger confirmatory studies."
PMC4515982,S147,,"Therefore, despite the bulk of preclinical findings in favour of a substantial protective activity of EPO outside the bone marrow, no evidence is currently available to support the hypothesis that rhEPO can rescue injured neurons in patients with acute or chronic progressive neurological diseases like stroke and ALS."
PMC4515982,S148,,"In most previous clinical studies of neuroprotection, cardioprotection and renal protection, rhEPO was acutely administered at doses ranging from 40â€…000â€…IU daily for 3â€…days to 50â€…000â€…IU 24 and 48â€…h after the event, whereas in critically ill patients the schedule was 40â€…000â€…IU weekly for 3â€…weeks.1"
PMC4515982,S149,,Ours is the first trial in which rhEPO was chronically administered to non-anaemic patients with a degenerative disease for a 12-month period.
PMC4515982,S150,,One limitation may appear to be the lack of a previous dose-finding study.
PMC4515982,S151,,"However, we have chosen the dosing schedule of rhEPO 40â€…000â€…IU fortnightly based on the pharmacokinetic profile, the known linear relationship between a single dose administered and erythropoietic response, and the turnover of reticulocytes,21 with the aim of reducing the thrombotic risk in patients."
PMC4515982,S152,,"Moreover, acute higher doses used in previous clinical studies increased the rate of thrombotic vascular events.1 40"
PMC4515982,S153,,"000â€…IU approximately equals one-third of the maximally effective single dose in a 70â€…kg participant (eg, 1800â€…IU/kg)."
PMC4515982,S154,,"In our study, it did not significantly increase the rate of thrombotic complications compared with the placebo group, most likely due to the small number of events, being the overall number of AEs twice as high as in the rhEPO treated group."
PMC4515982,S155,,"In rodent models,22 the dose of 2500â€…IU/kg/day was reported to be the most effective for neuroprotection but caused an increase of haematocrit value that would not be acceptable in humans."
PMC4515982,S156,,"A recent reappraisal of patientsâ€™ clinical features included in ALS trials suggested that the intrinsic limitations imposed by a classical randomised clinical trial can lead to the exclusion of patients representing the ALS population in clinical practice, reducing the reliability of the results.23"
PMC4515982,S157,,It has been suggested that the enrolment of patients in the earliest phases of ALS could increase the probability of identifying successful disease-modifying treatments.
PMC4515982,S158,,"In our study, the percentage of patients excluded due to respiratory insufficiency (15%) and of those who did not reach the diagnostic certainty level of probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria (1.5%) at randomisation was small compared with previous trials."
PMC4515982,S159,,"Similarly, gender distribution was well balanced between arms, thus avoiding the underrepresentation of women observed in other trials.23"
PMC4515982,S160,,"However, the mean age of ALS onset was slightly lower than that recorded in epidemiological studies,24â€“27 possibly accounting for the lower 1-year death rates."
PMC4515982,S161,,"Like previous trials in ALS, results from our pilot study did not replicate in the larger phase III trial."
PMC4515982,S162,,"In particular, in the pilot study, we had observed a higher prevalence of primary outcome events (death and tracheotomy) in the placebo group at 18â€…months follow-up, most likely a chance result due to the small sample size."

PMC4621368,S2,,Perioperative elafin for ischaemia-reperfusion injury during coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomised-controlled trial
PMC4621368,S3,,Abstract
PMC4621368,S4,,Background
PMC4621368,S5,,Elafin is a potent endogenous neutrophil elastase inhibitor that protects against myocardial inflammation and injury in preclinical models of ischaemic-reperfusion injury.
PMC4621368,S6,,We investigated whether elafin could inhibit myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury induced during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
PMC4621368,S7,,Methods and results
PMC4621368,S8,,"In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial, 87 patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomised 1:1 to intravenous elafin 200â€…mg or saline placebo administered after induction of anaesthesia and prior to sternotomy."
PMC4621368,S9,,Myocardial injury was measured as cardiac troponin I release over 48â€…h (area under the curve (AUC)) and myocardial infarction identified with MRI.
PMC4621368,S10,,Postischaemic inflammation was measured by plasma markers including AUC high-sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).
PMC4621368,S11,,Elafin infusion was safe and resulted in >3000-fold increase in plasma elafin concentrations and >50% inhibition of elastase activity in the first 24â€…h.
PMC4621368,S12,,"This did not reduce myocardial injury over 48â€…h (ratio of geometric means (elafin/placebo) of AUC troponin I 0.74 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.15, p=0.18)) although post hoc analysis of the high-sensitive assay revealed lower troponin I concentrations at 6â€…h in elafin-treated patients (median 2.4 vs 4.1â€…Î_g/L, p=0.035)."
PMC4621368,S13,,"Elafin had no effect on myocardial infarction (elafin, 7/34 vs placebo, 5/35 patients) or on markers of inflammation: mean differences for AUC hs-CRP of 499â€…mg/L/48 h (95% CI âˆ’207 to 1205, p=0.16), and AUC MPO of 238â€…ng/mL/48 h (95% CI âˆ’235 to 711, p=0.320)."
PMC4621368,S14,,Conclusions
PMC4621368,S15,,There was no strong evidence that neutrophil elastase inhibition with a single-dose elafin treatment reduced myocardial injury and inflammation following CABG-induced ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

PMC4621368,S17,,"(EudraCT 2010-019527-58, ISRCTN82061264)."
PMC4621368,S18,,Introduction
PMC4621368,S19,,Ischaemia-reperfusion injury occurs when blood flow is restored to organs and tissues that have sustained a period of interrupted blood supply.
PMC4621368,S20,,"This occurs following therapies for acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and is a necessary consequence of solid organ transplantation."
PMC4621368,S21,,Mechanisms of cell and tissue injury include a neutrophil-mediated postischaemic inflammatory response and activation of cellular death pathways following reperfusion.1
PMC4621368,S22,,Protecting organs from ischaemia-reperfusion injury to improve clinical outcome is a high priority.
PMC4621368,S23,,"Despite intense research efforts and huge promise from preclinical and early-phase clinical trials, there are currently no effective therapies that can limit this injurious response."
PMC4621368,S24,,"During coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary blood flow is interrupted and the heart is put into circulatory arrest."
PMC4621368,S25,,This causes ischaemia-reperfusion injury that is exacerbated by adverse neutrophil-mediated myocardial inflammation and injury.2â€“4
PMC4621368,S26,,CABG surgery therefore represents a programmed clinical model of ischaemia-reperfusion injury that lends itself to testing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions.5
PMC4621368,S27,,Elafin is an endogenous anti-inflammatory protein that was first isolated in the search for inhibitors of neutrophil elastase activity in the lung and skin.6 7
PMC4621368,S28,,It has inhibitory activity against both human neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3 as well as suppressing production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±).8
PMC4621368,S29,,"Elafin is produced locally at sites of inflammation, raising a local defence of â€˜alarmâ€™ antiproteases in order to contain and inhibit neutrophil-mediated inflammation.9"
PMC4621368,S30,,"Cardiovascular tissues do not express elafin or other neutrophil elastase inhibitors, and are therefore more vulnerable to neutrophil-mediated injury."
PMC4621368,S31,,Augmentation of human elafin has consistently demonstrated impressive protective effects in rodent models of ischaemic and inflammatory elastase-mediated vascular injury.
PMC4621368,S32,,Elafin infusion reduced muscular injury and neutrophil recruitment in the rat ischaemic hindlimb and myocardial ischaemiaâ€“reperfusion injury models.10 11
PMC4621368,S33,,Transgenic mice overexpressing human elafin under the control of the vascular pre-proendothelin promoter have relatively preserved LV size and function following myocardial infarction.12
PMC4621368,S34,,"Compared with wild-type littermates, these animals are also protected from viral myocarditis and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and exhibit less restenosis following wire-induced carotid artery denudation.13â€“15"
PMC4621368,S35,,"Elafin augmentation, therefore, protects the cardiovascular system from a range of conditions characterised by neutrophil elastase-mediated inflammation and injury."
PMC4621368,S36,,The purpose of the Elafin Myocardial Protection from Ischemia Reperfusion (EMPIRE) randomised-controlled clinical trial was to provide proof of concept that Elafin treatment could reduce myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion inflammation and injury in patients undergoing CABG surgery.

PMC4621368,S112,,"This is the first phase II clinical trial investigating the effect of elafin, an endogenous neutrophil elastase inhibitor, on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing CABG surgery."
PMC4621368,S113,,"Despite achieving >3000-fold increase in plasma concentrations sufficient to more than halve plasma elastase activity, we did not demonstrate clear evidence of beneficial effect of human recombinant elafin in our patients."
PMC4621368,S114,,"Specifically, we were unable to attenuate the systemic inflammatory response despite evidence of anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical disease models.19"
PMC4621368,S115,,"Nor could we conclusively detect a reduction in two very sensitive, complementary and gold standard measures of myocardial injury: AUC for plasma cTnI concentrations and late gadolinium enhancement on MRI despite preclinical studies with elafin reducing myocardial inflammation and injury after myocardial infarction.11 12"
PMC4621368,S116,,Differences between preclinical studies and the clinical CABG surgery model may have been responsible for different results.
PMC4621368,S117,,Elafin has never been tested in large animal models or in the setting of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
PMC4621368,S118,,"The surgical population was relatively low risk, and the use of isoflurane anaesthesia may provide cardioprotection.20"
PMC4621368,S119,,"Nevertheless, ischaemia-reperfusion injury in CABG surgery produced conditions where elafin would be expected to exert a treatment effect: neutrophil activation, elastase release and heightened circulating elastase activity together with activation of inflammatory cytokine pathways."
PMC4621368,S120,,"Elafin was safe and well tolerated in this high-risk clinical setting and post hoc analysis indicated reduced myocardial injury at 6â€…h, raising the possibility that more extensive treatment effect could have been seen with multiple doses or bolus and sustained infusions."
PMC4621368,S121,,All patients in our trial exhibited evidence of myocardial injury demonstrated by cTnI release.
PMC4621368,S122,,This was associated with a marginal reduction in LVEF detected on postoperative MRI.
PMC4621368,S123,,Small increases in delayed gadolinium enhancement indicative of new myocardial infarction were detected in a fifth of patients in keeping with subclinical myocardial injury and infarction that follows circulatory arrest and ischaemia-reperfusion during CABG surgery.
PMC4621368,S124,,The current MRI results contrast with an earlier study reporting increased infarct volume in 78% of patients undergoing planned CABG.21
PMC4621368,S125,,"A key difference that may explain this discrepancy is the detailed patient characterisation in our study with availability of preoperative MRI scans allowing identification of small areas of pre-existing infarct that would be missed by using clinical history, echocardiography or ECGs to screen for pre-existing infarction."
PMC4621368,S126,,Our data indicate that with single bolus administration elafin does not confer myocardial protection in the first 48â€…h following CABG surgery.
PMC4621368,S127,,This result was unchanged in a secondary analysis excluding patients who had sustained clinical events thought to be unrelated to study drug that would have contributed to large additional cTnI elevations.
PMC4621368,S128,,The absence of a convincing beneficial effect conflicts with preclinical ischaemia-reperfusion studies where elafin infusion was associated with a 27% reduction in myocardial infarct size and improved LV performance.
PMC4621368,S129,,Our clinical CABG model allows recapitulation of a key condition in preclinical models where elafin is administered upfront or expressed in tissues prior to the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass and ischaemic tissue injury.
PMC4621368,S130,,"However, despite this, we were unable to demonstrate clear efficacy using two complementary and highly sensitive measures of myocardial injury."
PMC4621368,S131,,Post hoc analysis identified a reduction in plasma cTnI concentrations at 6â€…h in elafin-treated patients.
PMC4621368,S132,,Preclinical studies used continuous elafin delivery by infusion or gene expression and the reduced cTnI concentration at an early postoperative time point raises the question whether continuous elafin infusion following the bolus may have extended the treatment effect to 48â€…h.
PMC4621368,S133,,Elafin is one of several agents targeting inflammatory pathways that have been investigated in ischaemia-reperfusion injury during cardiac surgery without success.
PMC4621368,S134,,"Pexelizumab, a recombinant, single-chain anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, was studied in two multicentre, randomised clinical trials of patients undergoing CABG surgery with or without valve surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass."
PMC4621368,S135,,There was no difference in the primary outcome of death or myocardial infarction between the pexelizumab and placebo treatment groups.22
PMC4621368,S136,,Failure of treatment effect with elafin and pexelizumab may reflect different mechanisms responsible for myocardial injury during CABG.
PMC4621368,S137,,"Myocardial ischaemia and necrosis undoubtedly occur during CABG surgery, and the magnitude of cTnI release is correlated with subsequent morbidity and mortality.23"
PMC4621368,S138,,Mechanism of ischaemia in preclinical models commonly involves complete interruption of coronary blood flow with a ligature to the beating heart.
PMC4621368,S139,,"In CABG surgery, the heart is in a state of circulatory arrest with protective cardioplegia and the impact of blood flow interruption is less severe."
PMC4621368,S140,,"Despite evidence of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory injury post-CABG, it may be activation of cellular survival pathways within cardiomyocytes that determines the outcome of ischaemia-reperfusion in this setting."
PMC4621368,S141,,Ischaemic preconditioning refers to resistance to acute myocardial ischaemia reperfusion conferred by the application of brief repeated episodes of ischaemia.
PMC4621368,S142,,This approach has been used successfully in CABG surgery to limit cardiac marker release.5
PMC4621368,S143,,"We demonstrated substantial (>50%) inhibition of circulating elastase activity by elafin following CABG surgery, and our data therefore indicate that neutrophil-derived elastase injury is not a prominent cause of myocardial injury in this setting."
PMC4621368,S144,,"The patients in our study did have evidence of neutrophil activation and degranulation with increased plasma concentrations of the primary granule contents, elastase and myeloperoxidase."
PMC4621368,S145,,"Peak elastase concentrations were reduced in elafin-treated patients, although there was no demonstrable effect on peak myeloperoxidase concentrations."
PMC4621368,S146,,This discrepancy is explained by differences in the origin of these two neutrophil primary granule proteins.
PMC4621368,S147,,Circulating human neutrophil elastase is derived largely from acute neutrophil degranulation.
PMC4621368,S148,,A pool of neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase is transcytosed and bound to the subendothelial matrix.24
PMC4621368,S149,,This contributes to the circulating pool and is released following heparin administration during cardiopulmonary bypass.25
PMC4621368,S150,,Elafin-mediated reductions in elastolytic activity and myeloperoxidase staining (as a marker of neutrophil infiltration) have been consistent findings in preclinical models.
PMC4621368,S151,,Elafin infusion produced impressive reductions in myocardial inflammation and necrosis in rabbits undergoing heterotopic cardiac transplantation.26
PMC4621368,S152,,This was associated with a marked attenuation of myocardial elastolytic activity in transplanted hearts.
PMC4621368,S153,,Transgenic mice overexpressing full-length human elafin under the control of the vascular pre-proendothelin promoter exhibit complete inhibition of tissue elastolytic activity following acute myocardial infarction and carotid arterial wire denudation.12 15
PMC4621368,S154,,These favourable treatment effects consistently occurred with reduced tissue myeloperoxidase content in keeping with less neutrophil recruitment.
PMC4621368,S155,,"We were not able to access myocardial tissue for assessment of neutrophil infiltration and elastolytic activity, but the significant reduction in peak elastase concentration leaves open the possibility of an elafin effect on neutrophil activation and degranulation, which, if present, was not large enough to translate into a reduction in AUC elastase at 6â€…h."
PMC4621368,S156,,The EMPIRE patients exhibited increased IL-8 and IL-6 production and increased levels of circulating hs-CRP in keeping with a postischaemic inflammatory response following CABG surgery.
PMC4621368,S157,,A systemic inflammatory response follows CABG surgery driven both by major surgical insult and contact activation of blood with artificial surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit.27
PMC4621368,S158,,Belief that the magnitude of this response may drive clinical outcome has led to trials examining interventions to reduce postoperative inflammation.
PMC4621368,S159,,"Peak and AUC hs-CRP, IL-6 and IL-8 release were similar between treatment groups."
PMC4621368,S160,,This result for elafin contrasts with previous work indicating broad-ranging anti-inflammatory activity in human endothelial cells and monocyte-derived macrophages.8
PMC4621368,S161,,The failure of elafin to suppress IL-8 production during CABG surgery may indicate that additional inflammatory pathways are active or that despite impacting on circulating elastase activity elafin is not reaching or is not active in the subcellular space between neutrophils and their target tissue.
PMC4621368,S162,,"Given lack of a conclusive therapeutic effect on myocardial injury and postischaemic inflammation, it is not surprising that the exploratory clinical end point of postoperative ITU stay was no different between treatment groups."
PMC4621368,S163,,Elafin infusion was safe.
PMC4621368,S164,,"There were no drug-related adverse events in this high-risk surgical group and no evidence of excessive bleeding, cardiovascular complications or renal dysfunction."
PMC4621368,S165,,"In conclusion, despite the body of work indicating therapeutic potential from several groups using different models, species and modes of augmentation, elafin's promise as a therapeutic agent to attenuate myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and inflammation was not translated in this first phase II clinical trial."
PMC4621368,S166,,"Post hoc analysis identified reduced cTnI concentrations at 6â€…h in elafin-treated patients, and it is possible that a bigger dose could have conferred protection out to 48â€…h."

PMC4621368,S168,,Key messagesWhat is already known on this subject?Ischaemia-reperfusion contributes to myocardial injury during cardiac surgery.
PMC4621368,S169,,Therapies to reduce injury remain elusive despite promise from preclinical studies.

PMC4770816,S4,,ObjectiveÂ To assess whether using intensive blood pressure targets leads to lower blood pressure in a community population of people with prevalent cerebrovascular disease.
PMC4770816,S5,,DesignÂ Open label randomised controlled trial.
PMC4770816,S6,,"SettingÂ 99 general practices in England, with participants recruited in 2009-11."
PMC4770816,S7,,ParticipantsÂ People with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack whose systolic blood pressure was 125 mm Hg or above.
PMC4770816,S8,,InterventionsÂ Intensive systolic blood pressure target (<130 mm Hg or 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline if this was <140 mm Hg) or standard target (<140 mm Hg).
PMC4770816,S9,,"Apart from the different target, patients in both arms were actively managed in the same way with regular reviews by the primary care team."

PMC4770816,S12,,84 patients withdrew from the study during the follow-up period (52 intensive arm; 32 standard arm).
PMC4770816,S13,,Mean systolic blood pressure dropped by 16.1 mm Hg to 127.4 mm Hg in the intensive target arm and by 12.8 mm Hg to 129.4 mm Hg in the standard arm (difference between groups 2.9 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 5.7) mm Hg; P=0.03).

PMC4770816,S17,,Introduction
PMC4770816,S18,,Stroke accounts for about 10% of deaths internationally and for more than 4% of direct healthcare costs in developed countries.1
PMC4770816,S19,,"If other resources, such as lost productivity, benefit payments, and informal care costs, are taken into account, the total costs double."
PMC4770816,S20,,"For example, in the United Kingdom, annual care costs are around Â£4.4bn (â‚¬5.7bn; $6.4bn), but total costs are Â£9bn a year.2"
PMC4770816,S21,,"More than 20% of strokes are recurrent events,3 and if one also takes into account previous history of transient ischaemic attack (TIA), this figure rises to about 30%.1"
PMC4770816,S22,,"Therefore, secondary prevention has a major potential role to play in reducing both morbidity and costs of stroke care."
PMC4770816,S23,,Hypertension is a key risk factor for stroke.
PMC4770816,S24,,A 20 mm Hg difference in usual systolic blood pressure is associated with a 60% lower risk of death from stroke in someone aged 50-70 years and a 50% lower risk in someone aged 70-79.4
PMC4770816,S25,,The PROGRESS trial showed that treatment to lower blood pressure in people who have had a stroke or TIA reduces the risk of further stroke.5
PMC4770816,S26,,"However, the best way to apply this evidence in clinical practice is debated.6 7"
PMC4770816,S27,,"In particular, uncertainty exists about how intensively to lower blood pressure in people who have had a stroke or TIA.8"
PMC4770816,S28,,A post hoc observational analysis of the PROFESS trial found that people with recent ischaemic stroke whose systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg had a higher risk of vascular events than those with a blood pressure between 1300 and 140 mm Hg.9
PMC4770816,S29,,"Conversely, participants in PROGRESS whose baseline systolic blood pressure was 120-140 mm Hg and who were randomised to combination therapy had a significantly reduced risk of stroke.10"
PMC4770816,S30,,The SPS3 trial of different blood pressure targets in younger (mean age 63 years) patients with recent lacunar stroke found a non-significant 19% reduction in risk of stroke after one year in people treated with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 130 mm Hg compared with a 130-149 mm Hg target.11
PMC4770816,S31,,"Recent guidelines have drawn different conclusions from the evidence base; the European guidelines recommend a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg (or higher),12 and British guidelines recommend a target of 130 mm Hg.13"
PMC4770816,S32,,"In view of these controversies, the Prevention After Strokeâ€”Blood Pressure (PAST-BP) study compared two different targets for blood pressure lowering after stroke or TIA in people recruited from a prevalent primary care population.14"
PMC4770816,S33,,"The aim was to determine whether setting a more intensive target in primary care would lead to a lower blood pressure, as a prelude to a trial powered to detect whether such a strategy would lead to a reduction in recurrence of stroke."

PMC4770816,S101,,Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise
PMC4770816,S102,,The intensive target arm was associated with significantly more consultations for blood pressure control with the general practitioner (median visits 2 v 1; P<0.001) and practice nurse (median 3 v 2; P=0.002) than the standard target arm.
PMC4770816,S103,,This higher consultation rate led to more intensifications of blood pressure treatment (458 v 278; P<0.001) and more changes due to side effects (77 v 30; P<0.001).
PMC4770816,S104,,"However, patients were also less likely to have their blood pressure treatment increased after review by the general practitioner when the blood pressure was above target in the intensive arm (109 v 57; P=0.005) (table 2)."
PMC4770816,S105,,"The three factors that contributed most to this difference were symptoms attributed to blood pressure drugs, blood pressure only just above target, and patient not wanting treatment intensified."
PMC4770816,S106,,"At the end of the study, the number of antihypertensive drugs that patients were taking had increased by a similar amount in both arms (mean number of antihypertensive drugs 2.1 in intensive arm and 1.9 in standard arm; P=0.13)."

PMC4770816,S108,,Treatment to a more intensive target was associated with a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at 12 months (primary outcome) (table 3).
PMC4770816,S109,,Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 16 mm Hg in the intensive target arm and by 13 mm Hg in the standard target arm.
PMC4770816,S110,,This difference persisted when we calculated it by using the mean of the fifth and sixth readings (âˆ’3.2 (95% confidence interval âˆ’5.8 to âˆ’0.64) mm Hg) or the mean of the second to sixth readings (âˆ’3.3 (âˆ’5.8 to âˆ’0.67) mm Hg) (supplementary table A).

PMC4770816,S125,,Discussion
PMC4770816,S126,,We found that aiming for a target systolic blood pressure of below 130 mm Hg or a 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline if this was below 140 mm Hg in a primary care population with prevalent cerebrovascular disease led to a lower systolic blood pressure than if a target of below 140 mm Hg target was aimed for.
PMC4770816,S127,,"However, the difference was small (about 3 mm Hg) and was associated with increased workload (one extra consultation a year each for general practitioners and nurses)."
PMC4770816,S128,,"The intensive target arm was not associated with more side effects as measured at follow-up, but more changes to treatment occurred because of side effects during the trial."
PMC4770816,S129,,"More people from the intensive target arm withdrew consent for the trial, and this might have reflected unwillingness to persevere with the increased treatment regimen."
PMC4770816,S130,,"Perhaps the most important finding was the greater than 10 mm Hg reductions in mean systolic blood pressure in both arms of the study, so that more than 80% of participants in each arm had achieved a blood pressure of below 140 mm Hg by the end of the trial, compared with less than 50% at baseline."
PMC4770816,S131,,Strengths and weaknesses of study
PMC4770816,S132,,Blood pressure at 12 months was not available for 28% of patients randomised.
PMC4770816,S133,,"This reflected a high number of withdrawals from the study, with some differential loss to follow-up in the intensive target arm."
PMC4770816,S134,,"However, when we imputed missing values by using multiple imputation (the most robust method), the difference in achieved blood pressure between arms at one year was very similar to that observed."
PMC4770816,S135,,"Although we did not achieve our sample size, in the event our trial was adequately powered, as the observed standard deviation in blood pressure was less than we had anticipated in our sample size calculation."
PMC4770816,S136,,This is reflected in the statistical significance of the small difference in observed blood pressure between arms.
PMC4770816,S137,,"Nevertheless, the upper limit of the confidence interval around the difference between arms at one year was 5.68 mm Hg, which would be regarded as a clinically important effect."
PMC4770816,S138,,Only 4% of patients on general practice stroke/TIA registers participated in the trial.
PMC4770816,S139,,"Participants had a low prevalence of disability for a prevalent cerebrovascular disease population, were younger than typical patients in primary care with a history of cerebrovascular disease, and over-represented people with a history of TIA only.7"
PMC4770816,S140,,"It is likely, therefore, that the more intensive target would have been even harder to achieve if the trial population was more representative of people with prevalent cerebrovascular disease."
PMC4770816,S141,,The trial represents a post-stroke primary care population managed by generalists rather than a selective hospital/outpatient population managed by specialists.
PMC4770816,S142,,"The outcome measure was not blinded, but a nurse not directly involved in the participantâ€™s care obtained it by using an automated sphygmomanometer, so systematic recording bias is unlikely."
PMC4770816,S143,,"The standard target arm in PAST-BP was actively managed, with the support of a computer based algorithm that suggested drug changes, rather than simply receiving â€œusual care.â€ù"
PMC4770816,S144,,"If we had used a more passive management strategy in the comparison group, we may have achieved a greater separation in systolic blood pressure between arms."
PMC4770816,S145,,"In another blood pressure lowering study of patients with increased cardiovascular risk carried out by our group in the same timeframe, the standard care control arm dropped by 6 mm Hg from a similar baseline compared with 13 mm Hg in the study reported here.17"
PMC4770816,S146,,We used an active control because we wanted to ascertain the effect of setting different blood pressure targets and to avoid confounding that would be introduced by having different management strategies in the two arms.
PMC4770816,S147,,"The target in the intensive arm was more complicated than that in the standard care arm, but we minimised the effect of this on adherence to the protocol by ensuring that the primary care staff managed all trial participants in the same way, with prompts to review treatment if blood pressure was above the individualised target."
PMC4770816,S148,,Comparison with other studies and interpretation
PMC4770816,S149,,"The change in mean blood pressure that we observed in the intensive target arm was very similar to that observed in the below 130 mm Hg target arm of the SPS3 trial, with both PAST-BP and SPS3 achieving a mean systolic blood pressure in the intensive arm of 127 mm Hg after one year.11"
PMC4770816,S150,,"However, the comparison arms had different achieved blood pressures (129 mm Hg in PAST-BP versus 138 mm Hg in SPS3)."
PMC4770816,S151,,This reflects the more conservative target in the higher target arm of SPS3 (130-149 mm Hg as opposed to <140 mm Hg) and that antihypertensive treatment was reduced if blood pressure fell below target.
PMC4770816,S152,,"Most of the observed reduction in blood pressure is likely to have been mediated by increased use of antihypertensive drugs, which on average went up from one to two drugs per person over the year of the study in both arms of the trial."
PMC4770816,S153,,"Alternative explanations are that habituation to blood pressure measurement occurred, leading to reduced white coat effect, or that there was regression dilution bias."
PMC4770816,S154,,"However, in a blood pressure monitoring trial in a similar post-stroke population with similar mean baseline systolic blood pressure, no fall in blood pressure was observed in the control group over a 12 month period,18 and in the SPS3 trial (also with similar mean baseline systolic blood pressure to PAST-BP) a fall of just 4 mm Hg was seen in the 140 mm Hg target arm over the study period.11"
PMC4770816,S155,,This suggests that the fall of 13 mm Hg observed in the standard target arm of PAST-BP is unlikely to be primarily due to effects of regression dilution or habituation to measurement.
PMC4770816,S156,,"Given that we had a relatively low systolic blood pressure inclusion criterion of 125 mm Hg or above, important regression dilution bias would not be anticipated in this study."
PMC4770816,S157,,Only 51% of patients in the intensive target arm of PAST-BP achieved their target blood pressure.
PMC4770816,S158,,Both patientsâ€™ wishes and general practitionersâ€™ decision making led to treatment not being intensified when blood pressure was above target (table 2).
PMC4770816,S159,,"Greater reluctance to lower blood pressure when near target, higher attribution of symptoms to blood pressure treatment (table 2) despite an absence of objective evidence of increased symptoms (table 4) in the intensive target arm, and greater reluctance of patients to increase treatment hint at the difficulties faced in achieving lower blood pressure targets in clinical practice.19"
PMC4770816,S160,,This impression of practical difficulty is reinforced by the significantly higher proportion of participants that withdrew from the trial in the intensive arm.
PMC4770816,S161,,"Although reported side effects and symptoms were similar in the two arms, and serious adverse events were infrequent (two admissions for falls in each arm), significantly more changes to treatment needed to be made because of side effects in the intensive target arm."
PMC4770816,S162,,Implications
PMC4770816,S163,,Recent evidence from SPRINT and a systematic review highlight the benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering.20 21
PMC4770816,S164,,"In some blood pressure target trials such as SPRINT and SPS3, the trial design maximised the achieved difference in blood pressure between the two arms, with the less intensive arm having a target range rather than simply a below 140 mm Hg systolic target, and with treatment being reduced if blood pressure fell below the target range."
PMC4770816,S165,,This is an appropriate design for an explanatory trial designed to test the question does lowering blood pressure reduce risk of cardiovascular events?
PMC4770816,S166,,"In our pragmatic trial, which sought to test the effect of different blood pressure targets as they would be used in clinical practice, the protocol did not stipulate a reduction in blood pressure treatment if the blood pressure was below target and the control arm was actively managed to achieve a target blood pressure below 140 mm Hg."
PMC4770816,S167,,"As a result of this, and of reluctance on the part of both clinicians and patients to instigate all increases in blood pressure treatment in the intensive group, the achieved difference in blood pressure between the two arms was small."
PMC4770816,S168,,"Nevertheless, we found that active management was associated with clinically important reductions in blood pressure in both armsâ€”the 13 mm Hg reduction achieved in the below 140 mm Hg arm equates to more than 40% and 20% reduction in the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease respectively.22"
PMC4770816,S169,,The reduction in blood pressure in our less intensive arm was similar to that achieved in the active arms of other blood pressure lowering trials and more than in their control groups.11 17
PMC4770816,S170,,The additional resources needed to achieve the additional 3 mm Hg lower blood pressure in the intensive target arm might be better spent in increasing the proportion of people with stroke in primary care who have a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg.
PMC4770816,S171,,"Given this conclusion, we did not feel that a pragmatic trial powered to detect a difference in cardiovascular endpoints achieved using an intensive target in primary care was warranted."
PMC4770816,S172,,"Furthermore, the ongoing ESH-CHL SHOT trial will provide important data on whether intensive blood pressure lowering reduces cardiovascular events in people with stroke (who were excluded from the SPRINT trial).23"
PMC4770816,S173,,The explanatory trial design is likely to lead to clear differences in achieved blood pressure in the treatment arms and confirm whether intensive blood pressure lowering reduces cardiovascular endpoints in the post-stroke population.
PMC4770816,S174,,What is already know on this topic
PMC4770816,S175,,"Decreasing blood pressure after stroke is associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence, but uncertainty exists about what the target blood pressure should be"
PMC4770816,S176,,One trial in people with recent lacunar stroke found that a systolic blood pressure target of <130 mm Hg was associated with a non-significant reduction in stroke compared with a target of 130-149 mm Hg
PMC4770816,S177,,No trials of different blood pressure targets after stroke have been carried out in primary care settings
PMC4770816,S178,,What this study adds
PMC4770816,S179,,Patients set a target of <130 mm Hg or a 10 mm Hg reduction if initial blood pressure was <140 mm Hg achieved lower systolic blood pressures than those set a target of <140 mm Hg
PMC4770816,S180,,"However, the difference was small (3 mm Hg) in the context of the reduction in blood pressure observed in both arms (13 mm Hg and 16 mm Hg)"

PMC4797126,S2,,A randomized trial of the efficacy and safety of quilizumab in adults with inadequately controlled allergic asthma
PMC4797126,S3,,Abstract
PMC4797126,S4,,Background
PMC4797126,S5,,"Quilizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, targets the M1-prime segment of membrane-expressed IgE, leading to depletion of IgE-switched and memory B cells."
PMC4797126,S6,,"In patients with mild asthma, quilizumab reduced serum IgE and attenuated the early and late asthmatic reaction following whole lung allergen challenge."
PMC4797126,S7,,"This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of quilizumab in adults with allergic asthma, inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller."
PMC4797126,S8,,Methods
PMC4797126,S9,,"Five hundred seventy-eight patients were randomized to monthly or quarterly dosing regimens of subcutaneous quilizumab or placebo for 36Â weeks, with a 48-week safety follow-up."
PMC4797126,S10,,"Quilizumab was evaluated for effects on the rate of asthma exacerbations, lung function, patient symptoms, serum IgE, and pharmacokinetics."
PMC4797126,S11,,"Exploratory analyses were conducted on biomarker subgroups (periostin, blood eosinophils, serum IgE, and exhaled nitric oxide)."
PMC4797126,S12,,Results
PMC4797126,S13,,"Quilizumab was well tolerated and reduced serum total and allergen-specific IgE by 30â€“40Â %, but had no impact on asthma exacerbations, lung function, or patient-reported symptom measures."
PMC4797126,S14,,"At Week 36, the 300Â mg monthly quilizumab group showed a 19.6Â % reduction (pâ€‰=â€‰0.38) in the asthma exacerbation rate relative to placebo, but this was neither statistically nor clinically significant."
PMC4797126,S15,,Biomarker subgroups did not reveal meaningful efficacy benefits following quilizumab treatment.
PMC4797126,S16,,Conclusions
PMC4797126,S17,,Quilizumab had an acceptable safety profile and reduced serum IgE.
PMC4797126,S18,,"However, targeting the IgE pathway via depletion of IgE-switched and memory B cells was not sufficient for a clinically meaningful benefit for adults with allergic asthma uncontrolled by standard therapy."

PMC4797126,S23,,Background
PMC4797126,S24,,"Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, affects over 300 million people worldwide [1]."
PMC4797126,S25,,Some patients have persistent symptoms despite the use of steroids and other therapies.
PMC4797126,S26,,These patients are at the highest risk for future exacerbations and unscheduled use of healthcare resources [2].
PMC4797126,S27,,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with distinct endotypes, the pathogenic cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive disease in different patient subgroups [3â€“6]."
PMC4797126,S28,,"Allergic asthma is a hypersensitivity driven by the complex interaction of epithelial, dendritic, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells, leading to activation of CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells in response to allergen exposure [7]."
PMC4797126,S29,,"Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and other cytokines that promote immunoglobulin E (IgE) class switching of B cells, increased IgE synthesis by plasma B cells, and recruitment and activation of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells."
PMC4797126,S30,,"When allergen cross-links IgE bound to IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils, cell activation and allergic mediator release occur, which may lead to mucus production and airway hyperreactivity [8]."
PMC4797126,S31,,"Biomarkers in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, and bronchial biopsies may indicate a particular endotype and potentially identify patients with increased responsiveness to endotype-specific treatments [5, 9]."
PMC4797126,S32,,"For example, elevated levels of serum periostin, an extracellular matrix protein induced by IL-4 and IL-13 in airway epithelium, identified a subset of asthma patients who responded better to lebrikizumab, an anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody [10]."
PMC4797126,S33,,"Similarly, patients with high levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), blood eosinophils, or serum periostin, had fewer asthma exacerbations following treatment with omalizumab, a neutralizing anti-IgE antibody, than patients with low biomarker levels [11]."
PMC4797126,S34,,These data suggest that IgE may drive allergic asthma in a subset of patients.
PMC4797126,S35,,"Quilizumab is a humanized, monoclonal IgG1 that binds to the M1-prime segment present only on membrane IgE [12], but not on soluble IgE in serum [13â€“15]."
PMC4797126,S36,,"Membrane IgE is expressed on IgE-switched B cells, IgE memory B cells, and IgE plasmablasts, but not on IgE plasma cells [16]."
PMC4797126,S37,,"In animal studies, anti-M1 prime bound membrane IgE on IgE-switched B cells and plasmablasts and depleted them through apoptosis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, leading to fewer IgE plasma cells and less production of soluble IgE [17]."
PMC4797126,S38,,"We previously evaluated the safety, tolerability, and activity of quilizumab in Phase Ia (31 healthy volunteers) [18], Phase Ib (24 allergic rhinitis patients) [19] and Phase IIa (15 mild asthma patients) [19] studies."
PMC4797126,S39,,"In these studies, quilizumab reduced serum total IgE by approximately 25Â %."
PMC4797126,S40,,"These decreases were sustained for at least 6Â months after the last dose, in contrast to omalizumab, which must be administered every 2â€“4 weeks to maintain reduced IgE levels [20]."
PMC4797126,S41,,"Quilizumab also abrogated the increase in challenge-specific IgE in patients with mild asthma following a whole-lung allergen challenge, and reduced the early and late asthmatic reactions [19]."
PMC4797126,S42,,Quilizumab may reset the IgE repertoire by targeting IgE production and provide a more sustained effect with a lower dose frequency then omalizumab.
PMC4797126,S43,,"The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of quilizumab after 36Â weeks of treatment in adults with allergic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller."

PMC4797126,S107,,"There were no major imbalances between treatment groups, but the 300Â mg monthly quilizumab group had a lower mean age (45 versus 47â€“48 years) and a lower median IgE level (190 versus 234â€“254Â IU/mL) compared to the other treatment arms (TableÂ 1)."
PMC4797126,S108,,89Â % (384/433) of patients who received quilizumab and 91Â % (132/145) of patients who received placebo completed the study treatment.

PMC4797126,S114,,"The treatment-emergent ATA rate was 1.4Â % in both the 150Â mg Q and 300Â mgÂ M groups, and 2.1Â % in the 450Â mg Q group."

PMC4797126,S116,,There was no apparent impact of positive ATA results on either pharmacokinetic profiles or safety.
PMC4797126,S117,,Pharmacokinetics
PMC4797126,S118,,Quilizumab displayed linear pharmacokinetics with a dose-proportional increase in exposure as shown by increases in Cmax values between the 150 and 450Â mg Q doses at Weeks 5 and 25.

PMC4797126,S148,,Discussion
PMC4797126,S149,,"In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of quilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the M1-prime segment of membrane IgE, in adult patients with allergic asthma that was inadequately controlled with standard therapy."
PMC4797126,S150,,"After 36Â weeks of treatment, quilizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies [18, 19]."
PMC4797126,S151,,"Quilizumab demonstrated clear pharmacological activity by reducing both serum total and allergen-specific IgE an average of 30â€“40Â % from baseline in all three treatment arms, in agreement with our previous work [18, 19]."
PMC4797126,S152,,"However, quilizumab treatment did not show consistent and clinically meaningful benefits in reducing asthma exacerbations or improving lung function, symptoms, or quality of life."
PMC4797126,S153,,"Subgroup analysis in patients with elevated serum periostin, blood eosinophils, FeNO, or serum IgE did not demonstrate a consistent treatment effect for quilizumab."
PMC4797126,S154,,It is important to understand that reducing serum IgE levels is not quilizumabâ€™s proposed mechanism of action.
PMC4797126,S155,,"Quilizumab did not reduce serum IgE as effectively as omalizumab (89â€“98Â % reduction of median free IgE) [26], but these two antibodies target the IgE pathway in distinctly different ways."
PMC4797126,S156,,"Quilizumab targets both B-cell switching to IgE and the new stimulation of IgE memory B cells and plasmablasts that lead to enhanced IgE production, processes that occur locally in the airways of allergic patients [16]."
PMC4797126,S157,,Quilizumabâ€™s ability to suppress the challenge-specific increase in serum IgE in our whole lung allergen challenge study in mild asthmatics supports this mechanism [19].
PMC4797126,S158,,We therefore hypothesize that quilizumab prevents the formation of short-lived IgE plasma cells in the airway.
PMC4797126,S159,,"Long-lived IgE plasma cells, which lack IgE on the surface, are not targeted by quilizumab and may be responsible for the remaining serum IgE detected in our studies [16]."
PMC4797126,S160,,"Another source of IgE not eliminated by quilizumab may be a subpopulation of IgG1 memory B cells that undergo a secondary switch to IgE when reactivated, and thereby become IgE memory cells [27]."
PMC4797126,S161,,The current study assessed the relevance of this mechanism on exacerbations in patients with inadequately controlled allergic asthma.
PMC4797126,S162,,"In the EXTRA study that examined a similar patient population, omalizumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbations by 25Â % in the all-patients group [24], by 53Â % in the FeNO-high subgroup, and by 32Â % in the eosinophil-high subgroup, relative to placebo."
PMC4797126,S163,,"In addition, asthma exacerbations were substantially reduced in the periostin-high subgroup (30Â %) relative to placebo [11]."
PMC4797126,S164,,"In contrast, in our study, quilizumab did not show significant clinical benefit in this population (Fig.Â 3) or in any subgroup (Fig.Â 4), possibly because local IgE production by short-lived IgE plasma cells is not critical for exacerbations and other clinical endpoints."
PMC4797126,S165,,"For this to be true, we must assume that: 1) quilizumab depleted all M1-prime-positive B cells, and 2) the doses in this study were sufficient to deplete all M1-prime-positive cells."
PMC4797126,S166,,"Despite our extensive efforts, we have not been able to accurately detect M1-prime-positive cells in patients with asthma [19], so we have no direct evidence of depletion."
PMC4797126,S167,,"However, all three quilizumab dose regimens led to a similar reduction in serum IgE levels, suggesting that quilizumab depleted all target cells, and indicating that higher doses would not have provided additional activity."
PMC4797126,S168,,"Interestingly, after stopping quilizumab dosing, serum IgE levels gradually increased, indicating that IgE-switching and formation of short-lived IgE plasma cells may occur continuously in this patient population, a finding not previously reported."
PMC4797126,S169,,"The allergen-challenge model used in our previous studies where quilizumab was shown to be effective [19] may not represent the asthma processes occurring in the patient population in this study, especially given that alternate sources of IgE appear to play a more dominant role."
PMC4797126,S170,,"However, the model was key in first demonstrating the effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with mild asthma, where omalizumab significantly reduced both the early and late asthmatic responses following allergen challenge and reduced serum IgE almost completely [28, 29]."
PMC4797126,S171,,"Although less effective than omalizumab in a similar population, quilizumab showed reductions of 26 and 36Â % in the early and late asthmatic responses, respectively, and a 25Â % reduction in serum IgE [19]."
PMC4797126,S172,,Allergen-challenge studies are generally exploratory and are designed to follow biomarkers that trend with early and late asthmatic responses.
PMC4797126,S173,,"They are usually conducted in patients with mild asthma, which is not the typical target population for new biologic therapies."
PMC4797126,S174,,"At least one therapy, mepolizumab (anti-IL-5), is effective for reducing asthma exacerbations in patients with eosinophilic asthma, yet does not appear to affect early/late asthmatic responses during allergen challenge [30, 31]."
PMC4797126,S175,,It is therefore crucial that appropriate patient populations and outcome measures are selected for future trials.
PMC4797126,S176,,"Whether quilizumab could have a clinically meaningful effect in another subgroup of allergic asthma patients or whether a treatment period beyond 36Â weeks would show efficacy, are questions we are unable to address with the current study."
PMC4797126,S177,,"The type 2 biomarkers, serum periostin, blood eosinophils, and FeNO, which identified patients with increased clinical benefit from lebrikizumab and omalizumab [10, 11], did not consistently enrich for increased benefit from quilizumab in this study."
PMC4797126,S178,,"Similarly, patients with elevated serum IgE levels at baseline did not respond better to quilizumab nor was there a correlation between serum IgE reduction and exacerbation reduction or FEV1 improvement (data not shown)."
PMC4797126,S179,,Conclusions
PMC4797126,S180,,"In adults with uncontrolled allergic asthma, a 36-week treatment with quilizumab, an anti-M1-prime monoclonal antibody that targets IgE-switched and IgE memory B cells, did not result in a clinically significant impact on exacerbation rate, lung function, or quality of life."
PMC4797126,S181,,"Our data on quilizumab activity indicate that there are major pathological mechanisms that extend beyond the new, local production of IgE in patients with inadequately controlled allergic asthma."

PMC4893154,S2,,Effects of Vitamin D on Cardiac Function inÂ Patients With Chronic HF
PMC4893154,S3,,Abstract
PMC4893154,S4,,Background
PMC4893154,S5,,Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are frequently deficient in vitamin D. Low vitamin D levels are associated with a worse prognosis.
PMC4893154,S6,,Objectives
PMC4893154,S7,,The VINDICATE (VitamIN D treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study was undertaken to establish safety and efficacy of high-dose 25 (OH) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD.
PMC4893154,S8,,Methods
PMC4893154,S9,,We enrolled 229 patients (179 men) with chronic HF due to LVSD and vitamin D deficiency (cholecalciferolÂ <50 nmol/l [<20 ng/ml]).
PMC4893154,S10,,"Participants were allocated to 1 year of vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU [100 Î_g] daily) or matching nonâˆ’calcium-based placebo."
PMC4893154,S11,,The primary endpoint was change in 6-minute walk distance between baseline and 12 months.
PMC4893154,S12,,"Secondary endpoints included change in LV ejection fraction at 1 year, and safety measures of renal function and serum calcium concentration assessed every 3 months."
PMC4893154,S13,,Results
PMC4893154,S14,,"One year of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve 6-min walk distance at 1 year, but was associated with a significant improvement in cardiac function (LV ejection fractionÂ +6.07% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.20 to 8.95; pÂ < 0.0001]); and a reversal of LV remodeling (LV end diastolic diameter -2.49 mm [95% CI: -4.09 to -0.90; pÂ = 0.002] and LV end systolic diameter -2.09 mm [95% CI: -4.11 to -0.06 pÂ = 0.043])."
PMC4893154,S15,,Conclusions
PMC4893154,S16,,One year of 100 Î_g daily vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve 6-min walk distance but hasÂ beneficial effects on LV structure and function in patients on contemporary optimal medical therapy.
PMC4893154,S17,,Further studiesÂ are necessary to determine whether these translate to improvements in outcomes.

PMC4893154,S117,,Central Illustration Vitamin D in Chronic Heart Failure: Impact on Left Ventricular Structure andÂ Function
PMC4893154,S118,,Vitamin D improves left ventricular ejection fractions and reduces left ventricular dimensions and volumes.
PMC4893154,S119,,VINDICATE aimed to examine the effect of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with chronic HF secondary to LVSD who underwent optimal medical therapy.
PMC4893154,S120,,"The results demonstrate that 4,000 IU vitamin D3 given for 12 months is safe, well tolerated, and not associated with concerning adverse biochemical effects (Central Illustration)."
PMC4893154,S121,,"There was no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the primary endpoint of 6MWT distance but there were statistically significant and prognostically and clinically relevant improvements in the secondary outcomes of LVEF and LV dimensions and volumes, thus suggesting that vitamin D is leading to beneficial reverse remodeling."
PMC4893154,S122,,"New therapies for serious chronic conditions including chronic HF are often expensive, increasingly technical, and frequently fail to meet the rigorous demands of large phase 3 clinical trials."
PMC4893154,S123,,Vitamin D might be an inexpensive and safe additional option for chronic HF patients and may have beneficial effects on multiple features of the syndrome (13).
PMC4893154,S124,,"Patients with chronic HF are frequently deficient in vitamin D, and low vitamin D levels increase the risk of incident chronic HF (26), and are associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF 6, 7, 8, 9, 12."
PMC4893154,S125,,Supplementation to treat or prevent osteoporotic fractures might be associated with a lower incidence of chronic HF (10).
PMC4893154,S126,,"However, despite the publication of studies exploring various doses and forms of vitamin D supplementation in patients with chronic HF, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the benefits of this therapeutic approach."
PMC4893154,S127,,"In the first study by Schleithoff etÂ al. (15), 93 subjects received 50Â Î_g vitamin D3Â + calcium (Ca2+) per day for 9Â months or placeboÂ + Ca2+."
PMC4893154,S128,,There was a trend to improvement of LV function measured by echocardiography and a smaller increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines during follow-up in those randomized to vitamin D. Both groups were given Ca2+ and both groups had some improvement in LV function with no differences between them.
PMC4893154,S129,,Witham etÂ al. (16) examined vitamin D2 supplementation in 105 elderly patients.
PMC4893154,S130,,"Subjects were randomized to 2 doses of 100,000 IU of vitamin D2 or placebo at baseline and 10 weeks and assessed at 20 weeks."
PMC4893154,S131,,"There was no effect on walk distance or immune function, and a slight deterioration in quality of life."
PMC4893154,S132,,"The population in that study was heterogeneous; patients with and without LVSD were included, mean N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide levels and daily furosemide doses were lower than those seen in a usual HF population, medical therapy was not optimized, the duration of treatment was short, patients who were randomized to vitamin D remained deficient (43.4 nmol/l [17.4Â ng/ml]), andÂ PTH was not suppressed (27)."
PMC4893154,S133,,"Although Boxer etÂ al. 28, 29 did not demonstrate improvements in cardiac function or objective measures of muscle strength and exercise capacity in 64 chronic HF patients (ofÂ whom 34 underwent echocardiography) randomized to weekly doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 6Â months, there was an improvement in serum aldosterone and quality of life in those allocated the supplement."
PMC4893154,S134,,"In an open-label study, Schroten etÂ al. (30) demonstrated a reduction in plasma renin concentration after 6 weeks of 2,000 IU vitamin D3 daily in 101 patients with chronic HF."
PMC4893154,S135,,"Finally, Dalbeni etÂ al. (31) noted an increase in LVEF of almost 7% after only 25 weeks in 13 patients randomized to 600,000 IU vitamin D3 at baseline and 2 further doses of 100,000 IU at 10 weeks and 20 weeks, whereas 10 patients randomized to placebo had a reduction in LVEF of more than 4%."
PMC4893154,S136,,The authors did not comment on cardiac dimensions and there was an increase in natriuretic peptide levels in both groups.
PMC4893154,S137,,"In contrast to these studies, VINDICATE is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an oral nonâˆ’calcium-based daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 administered for 12 months in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD on otherwise optimal medical therapy."
PMC4893154,S138,,The supplement led to consistent biochemical evidence of replenishment and an effective suppression of PTHÂ levels.
PMC4893154,S139,,The primary endpoint of VINDICATE was change in 6MWT distance.
PMC4893154,S140,,The study was based upon pilot dataÂ and powered to detect a 28-m difference between the 2 groups at 12 months (19).
PMC4893154,S141,,"The variability in the walk distance measure at baseline was much greater than predicted from our pilot study, such that our sample size only had 7% post hoc power to detect a difference between the groups."
PMC4893154,S142,,VINDICATE was therefore underpowered to detect a clinically relevant change in walk distance.
PMC4893154,S143,,"Six-minute walk distance is an increasingly frequently used patient-oriented outcome measure, but has greater variability than objective surrogate endpoints (20)."
PMC4893154,S144,,The findings from VINDICATE have implications for future studies using 6-min walk distance as an outcome measure.
PMC4893154,S145,,"However, our secondary endpoints of cardiac function and structure measured by echocardiography were highly statistically and clinically significant, with improvements in LVEF, and LV dimensions and volumes."
PMC4893154,S146,,"Similar changes were seen in a subgroup of patients agreeing to serial CMR imaging, although they did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance due to lack of power."
PMC4893154,S147,,"A pathophysiological hallmark of chronic HF secondary to LVSD is a progressive increase in LV cavity dimensions and impaired contractility, a process known as LV remodeling (32)."
PMC4893154,S148,,"Current accepted therapies for chronic HF which afford HF patients improvements in survival such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (33), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists 34, 35, and cardiac resynchronization therapy (36) have also been shown to have a favorable effect on LV remodeling by delaying progression of, or reversing LV dilatation."
PMC4893154,S149,,The degree of favorable remodeling induced by these treatments is related to long-term outcomes (37).
PMC4893154,S150,,It is therefore plausible that the improvements in cardiac function demonstrated in VINDICATE have the potential to improve outcomes.
PMC4893154,S151,,How does vitamin D contribute to beneficial remodeling?
PMC4893154,S152,,Vitamin D deficiency could contribute to adverse remodeling through 2 major pathways.
PMC4893154,S153,,Vitamin D deficiency could lead to cardiomyocyte dysfunction by interfering with Ca2+ transport (38) at a cellular concentration.
PMC4893154,S154,,HF is a condition of intracellular calcium overload that adversely affects both contraction and relaxation.
PMC4893154,S155,,"Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency might contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis (39)."
PMC4893154,S156,,"Hence, vitamin D deficiency could contribute to a more rapid progression to HF following myocardial damage due to more aggressive adverse remodeling (40)."
PMC4893154,S157,,"However, adverse remodeling is also the result of persistent neurohormonal activation, particularly that of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) which strongly contributes to deteriorating cardiac function, cardiomyocyte loss, and interstitial fibrosis (41)."
PMC4893154,S158,,Inhibition of the RAAS leads to attenuated or reverse LV remodeling in patients with HF (42).
PMC4893154,S159,,"Vitamin D deficiency heightens RAAS activity 30, 43, whereas vitamin D supplementation seems toÂ reduce renin synthesis (44) and plasma renin activity (43)."
PMC4893154,S160,,Study limitations
PMC4893154,S161,,VINDICATE was performed at a single center.
PMC4893154,S162,,"However, the study was based upon results from a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 53 patients using the same dose for 12 months that also showed a favorable effect of vitamin D on cardiac structure and function (19)."
PMC4893154,S163,,"We did not examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with chronic HF and preserved ejection fraction, a group of patients who may warrant such investigation."
PMC4893154,S164,,Conclusions
PMC4893154,S165,,"VINDICATE has demonstrated that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation is safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a clinically relevant improvement in cardiac function in chronic HF patients already taking current optimal therapies.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with chronic HF, vitamin D deficiency is common, and high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation is safe, well tolerated, and associated with a favorable effect on cardiac function.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to establish the mechanism by which correction of vitamin D3 deficiency improves cardiac function in patients with systolic HF and the generalizability of this response."

PMC4902320,S2,,The Important Role for Intravenous Iron in Perioperative Patient Blood Management in Major Abdominal Surgery
PMC4902320,S3,,Abstract
PMC4902320,S4,,Objective:
PMC4902320,S5,,To determine if preoperative intravenous (IV) iron improves outcomes in abdominal surgery patients.
PMC4902320,S6,,Summary Background Data:
PMC4902320,S7,,"Preoperative iron deficiency anemia (IDA) occurs frequently; however if left untreated, increases the risk of blood transfusion allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT)."
PMC4902320,S8,,Limited evidence supports IDA treatment with preoperative IV iron.
PMC4902320,S9,,This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether perioperative IV iron reduced the need for ABT.
PMC4902320,S10,,Methods:
PMC4902320,S11,,"Between August 2011 and November 2014, 72 patients with IDA were assigned to receive either IV iron or usual care."
PMC4902320,S12,,The primary endpoint was incidence of ABT.
PMC4902320,S13,,"Secondary endpoints were various hemoglobin (Hb) levels, change in Hb between time points, length of stay, iron status, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life 4 weeks postsurgery."
PMC4902320,S14,,Results:
PMC4902320,S15,,A 60% reduction in ABT was observed in the IV iron group compared with the usual care group (31.25% vs 12.5%).
PMC4902320,S16,,"Hb values, although similar at randomization, improved by 0.8â€_g/dL with IV iron compared with 0.1â€_g/dL with usual care (P = 0.01) by the day of admission."
PMC4902320,S17,,"The IV iron group had higher Hb 4 weeks after discharge compared with the usual care group (1.9 vs 0.9â€_g/dL, P = 0.01), and a shorter length of stay (7.0 vs 9.7 d, P = 0.026)."
PMC4902320,S18,,"There was no difference in discharge Hb levels, morbidity, mortality, or quality of life."
PMC4902320,S19,,Conclusions:
PMC4902320,S20,,"Administration of perioperative IV iron reduces the need for blood transfusion, and is associated with a shorter hospital stay, enhanced restoration of iron stores, and a higher mean Hb concentration 4 weeks after surgery."
PMC4902320,S21,,Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are common conditions affecting a quarter of the world's population.1
PMC4902320,S22,,"Aside from age, socioeconomic circumstances, poor nutrition, and pregnancy, many pathological states frequently lead to iron depletion."
PMC4902320,S23,,"In patients presenting for noncardiac surgery, ID with or without anemia is found in up to 39% of patients.2"
PMC4902320,S24,,"In certain subgroups, like colorectal cancer or patients with heavy menstrual bleeding, the occurrence of preoperative anemia has been found to be as high as 57 %.3,4"
PMC4902320,S25,,"The cause of the ID is either disease related, for which the patient is being treated, or therapy related, as for many individuals on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.5"
PMC4902320,S26,,"Anemia, ABT, and perioperative significant blood loss have all been established as adversely impacting clinical outcomes.6"
PMC4902320,S27,,"Perioperatively, anemic patients frequently are exposed to allogeneic transfusion events, increased rates of infections, increased numbers of cardiac complications, an increased number of days in hospital, and more deaths.2,7â€“9"
PMC4902320,S28,,"Anemia is often corrected by ABT, despite the evidence that even small amounts of transfused allogeneic red cells have a significant negative effect on morbidity, mortality,10 and reduces cancer-related survival and overall survival in colorectal cancer patients.9"
PMC4902320,S29,,"Transfusion-associated hazards and the noninferiority of restrictive transfusion approaches have been demonstrated, challenging traditional transfusion practice.11â€“13"
PMC4902320,S30,,"Comprehensive patient blood management (PBM) programs offering effective approaches for minimizing perioperative blood loss and optimized patient care have been designed and implemented in some countries.14,15"
PMC4902320,S31,,"However, due to evidence gaps, translational delays for existing evidence, and ongoing skepticism, transfusion practices continue to vary considerably among clinicians.16"
PMC4902320,S32,,"Preoperative optimization of anemia seems to be a key aspect of PBM.6,16,17"
PMC4902320,S33,,"In particular, patients scheduled for major surgery and with medical conditions often associated with ID should be assessed at least 4 weeks before surgery to allow clinicians to interpret blood results with a window of opportunity to act and correct reversible hemopoietic deficiencies.17â€“19"
PMC4902320,S34,,"Both oral and IV iron have been shown to correct ID and IDA,20,21 but neither has become standard practice,22 nor has the ideal timing of preoperative intervention for IV iron been determined.20,23"
PMC4902320,S35,,"Oral iron replacement is in many instances poorly tolerated, ineffective, or even detrimental.24,25,26"
PMC4902320,S36,,"There is increasing evidence that in select patient groups presenting for elective surgery and in urgent cases, treatment with IV iron might benefit the patient and should result in a reduction of RBC transfusion and transfusion-related adverse events.17,27"
PMC4902320,S37,,"Should an increased use of IV iron for at-risk patients have the predicted effect of improved hematological parameters and restored iron levels, the impact would translate to significant benefits for the individual in the immediate postoperative period and the weeks after hospital discharge."

PMC4902320,S67,,Statistical Analysis
PMC4902320,S76,,RESULTS
PMC4902320,S77,,"An early interim data analysis was requested following concerns raised by the clinical investigator team after high rates of RBC transfusion, considered to be an independent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes, noted after the 4-week follow-up in a subset of patients."
PMC4902320,S78,,"This was performed by an independent statistician on the interim data-monitoring committee with the data blinded (intervention group n = 32, usual care group n = 26)."
PMC4902320,S79,,The results of the interim analysis were forwarded to 2 independent experts in the field to assess safety concerns.
PMC4902320,S80,,Enrolment continued while waiting for a response.
PMC4902320,S81,,"There was disagreement among the assessors, and a third independent expert opinion was sought."
PMC4902320,S82,,"Based on advice from 2 of the 3 independent experts, the study was terminated early due to higher than expected rates of poor outcome in the usual care group."
PMC4902320,S83,,"At the time of study termination, 72 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized (intervention group n = 40, usual care group n = 32) (see Supplemental Digital Content eFigure 1)."
PMC4902320,S84,,"Group characteristics are shown in Table 1, and the type of surgery for the patient groups is shown in Supplementary Table 1."
PMC4902320,S85,,Cancer was the underlying condition in 73% of group 1 patients and 85% of patients in the usual care group.
PMC4902320,S86,,The overall transfusion rate in the study was 20.8%.
PMC4902320,S87,,"Ten patients in the usual care group (10/32 = 31.25%) were transfused vs 5 in the intervention group (5/40 = 12.5%), equating to a 60% relative reduction in transfusions between the 2 groups shown in Table 2."
PMC4902320,S88,,"There were no intraoperative RBC transfusions in the intervention group compared with 5 in the usual care group (P = 0.014) and a significant reduction in the number of total perioperative ABT events in group 1 (5/40, 12.5 %) compared with group 2 (17/32, 53 %), P < 0.0003."
PMC4902320,S89,,The median number of units per transfused patient was also decreased in the intervention group (2 compared with 3 in the usual care group; P = 0.016; Table 2).
PMC4902320,S90,,There was no difference in the rationale for transfusion between the 2 groups with the majority being performed due to low hemoglobin (Supplementary Table 2).
PMC4902320,S91,,The median IV iron dose administered to participants in the intervention group was 1200â€_mg (IQR 1088â€“1363).
PMC4902320,S92,,Five participants in the usual care group were given a median IV iron dose of 1800â€_mg (IQR 1467â€“2000).
PMC4902320,S93,,Any participant receiving IV iron had a maximum of 2 infusions.
PMC4902320,S94,,No serious adverse event resulted from the iron infusion.
PMC4902320,S95,,"Three participants suffered the following mild adverse events: headache, light-headedness, and back pain."
PMC4902320,S96,,The latter settled with simple analgesics.
PMC4902320,S97,,Hb levels across study period and other important secondary outcome parameters are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
PMC4902320,S98,,Hb values were not different at randomization and improved by 0.8â€_g/dL in group 1 and by 0.1â€_g/dL in the usual care group (P = 0.01) by the day of admission.
PMC4902320,S99,,"Despite higher transfusion rate in the usual care group, there were no differences between groups in discharge Hb (10.3 vs 10.2â€_g/dL for the intervention group and usual care group, respectively)."
PMC4902320,S100,,"However, Hb increased by 1.9â€_g/dL in the intervention group and 0.9â€_g/dL in the usual care group (P = 0.01) from the time of discharge to follow-up and was significantly higher at 4 weeks postsurgery (12.2â€_g/dL compared with 11.1â€_g/dL in the usual care group, P < 0.001)."
PMC4902320,S101,,"Length of stay was shortened by 3 days in the intervention group compared with the usual care group (6 vs 9 d, P = 0.05)."
PMC4902320,S102,,There was no significant difference in morbidity or mortality (Table 4).
PMC4902320,S103,,"QoL scores were higher at baseline for the intervention group; however, score reduction was equal between the groups."

PMC4902320,S108,,DISCUSSION
PMC4902320,S109,,"This first RCT on managing preoperative anemia in abdominal surgery, involving only patients with confirmed IDA, demonstrates the important role for IV iron in perioperative PBM."
PMC4902320,S110,,"The results also highlight the ongoing mismanagement of a treatable condition despite the well-known negative impact of IDA.29,30"
PMC4902320,S111,,"In addition, it also confirms the ongoing overuse of ABT as a default treatment approach31â€“33 regardless of the well-described transfusion-related risks34 and the safety of restrictive transfusion practices.10,12,13"
PMC4902320,S112,,"We also report that although Hb levels were equivalent in the 2 groups at discharge, they were 1â€_g/dL higher in the treatment group compared with the usual care group at 4 weeks after surgery."
PMC4902320,S113,,"This demonstrates that perioperative iron repletion has substantial benefit in the postoperative recovery period, potentially due to the iron repletion allowing bone marrow to increase erythropoiesis, compared with transfused RBCs which are rapidly cleared from the circulation and have a shorter lifespan than normal RBCs.35"
PMC4902320,S114,,The superiority of IV iron over oral or no iron in reducing ABT was previously demonstrated in other clinical setting and extensively discussed in a recent review by MuÃ±oz.36
PMC4902320,S115,,Transfusion triggers and the appropriateness of ABT administration were the focus of perioperative transfusion management at the time when we designed this study.
PMC4902320,S116,,"Our aim was to determine whether perioperative IV iron, administered within 4 to 21 days before substantial abdominal surgery, would lead to a significant reduction in transfusion events."
PMC4902320,S117,,"We anticipated that we would demonstrate that this intervention would not only obviate ABT, but also correct underlying iron deficits, facilitating better recovery and outcomes."
PMC4902320,S118,,"Since the commencement of our study, the importance of correcting preoperative ID has been more widely accepted as an appropriate standard of care, strengthening our hypothesis.6,17,18,21,37"
PMC4902320,S119,,"The value of preoperative correction of IDA has thus become a cornerstone of PBM guidelines around the world.14,15,38"
PMC4902320,S120,,"However, data monitoring of our participants indicated that a large proportion of enrolled subjects in the usual care group were transfused with RBC to correct anemia but received no treatment for their ID."
PMC4902320,S121,,"RBC transfusion is considered to be an independent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes.10,31,39"
PMC4902320,S122,,"Recognition of this situation and the ethical responsibility to our participants prompted an interim analysis, and the seeking of advice from impartial experts to assess whether early termination of the study was recommended scientifically and ethically."
PMC4902320,S123,,Enrolment in the study continued during the assessment and decision-making process.
PMC4902320,S124,,"After definitive analysis of the expert opinion, it was deemed that the study should be terminated in the interest of the patients."
PMC4902320,S125,,"As early as 1985, influenced by the AIDS epidemic, strategies for avoiding or minimizing ABT were published.40"
PMC4902320,S126,,"Compelling evidence on the importance of anemia and blood management from the last 15 years 13,37,41 put PBM on the agenda and illustrated how PBM should be carried out."
PMC4902320,S127,,"Logically, one would expect that â€œstandard careâ€ù had moved on."
PMC4902320,S128,,"However, our results show that the translational gap is huge and that anemia management has some way to go in clinical practice.19,33,34,42â€“45"
PMC4902320,S129,,The assessment of adequate iron stores can be difficult.
PMC4902320,S130,,"With ferritin levels influenced by chronic disease and/or inflammation, ID may be masked."
PMC4902320,S131,,"Therefore, screened subjects were included with ferritin levels of less than 300â€_mcg/L in our study, as recommended in a consensus statement on the role of IV iron in perioperative anemia management.46"
PMC4902320,S132,,"The distribution of ferritin levels was essentially the same in the 2 groups of participants; 48% (intervention) and 40% (usual care) presented with profound ID, demonstrated by ferritin levels less than 30â€_mcg/L. Despite sometimes longstanding and previously diagnosed IDA, only 3 patients in our entire cohort had been prescribed oral iron replacement therapy within the 6 weeks before surgery."
PMC4902320,S133,,"Only 1 patient in the usual care group was treated with IV iron pre- and postoperatively, and 4 received IV iron while in hospital."
PMC4902320,S134,,"IV iron was not considered usual care, at the time of study commencement, nonetheless was not prohibited."
PMC4902320,S135,,Patients were randomized in our study between 8 and 10 days before admission.
PMC4902320,S136,,"Although it is desirable for ID to be corrected in a timely manner, the study establishes that a successful â€œrescueâ€ù intervention is available and effective at a later stage, even for those with profound IDA."
PMC4902320,S137,,"Our results support a proposed â€œopportunityâ€ù approach, discussed in a recent review article by MuÃ±oz et al, and suggested earlier based on results from pooled data by the same author.17,47"
PMC4902320,S138,,"In addition to risk minimization and outcome improvement, our findings might have significant economic implications."
PMC4902320,S139,,"According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 15,840 patients were diagnosed with bowel cancer in Australia in 2012 and many had to undergo abdominal surgery."
PMC4902320,S140,,Cancer patients made up the majority of our cohort.
PMC4902320,S141,,The patients randomized to receive pre- and postoperative IV iron left hospital 3 days earlier.
PMC4902320,S142,,"We suggest that this earlier discharge was due to treatment of ID with IV iron, thus minimizing the associated risks of this exposure."
PMC4902320,S143,,"Although a cost analysis was beyond the scope of this research, we propose that this would result in a significant cost savings, offsetting the initial expenditure of screening."
PMC4902320,S144,,Limitations
PMC4902320,S145,,Early termination is the main limitation of our study.
PMC4902320,S146,,"However, ethical concerns were paramount, and we made the necessary decision in the interest of our patients."
PMC4902320,S147,,"Although more cases would strengthen the statistics, it was not anticipated that the conclusions would change."
PMC4902320,S148,,In our view it would have been unethical to have iron-deficient patients in a control group at increased risk of receiving a blood transfusion.
PMC4902320,S149,,A serious hazard from an ABT resulting in morbidity or mortality in a control patient would be difficult to defend.
PMC4902320,S150,,Another limitation is that we performed simple randomization instead of block randomization.
PMC4902320,S151,,This was apparent at the time of the interim analysis and the final analysis after stopping the study.
PMC4902320,S152,,Block randomization would have achieved a more equal balance in the allocation of participants.
PMC4902320,S153,,"In this study, 5 participants randomized to the usual care group received IV iron as part of their standard care."
PMC4902320,S154,,"Although this may have influenced the results, the final analysis between groups would then represent a more conservative analysis of the effects of IV iron."
PMC4902320,S155,,This change in standard care of iron deficient patients further adds clarity to the decision for early termination.

PMC5009486,S2,,Dose-response to inhaled glycopyrrolate delivered with a novel Co-Suspensionâ„¢ Delivery Technology metered dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD
PMC5009486,S3,,Abstract
PMC5009486,S4,,Background
PMC5009486,S5,,This study forms part of the first complete characterization of the doseâ€“response curve for glycopyrrolate (GP) delivered using Co-Suspensionâ„¢ Delivery Technology via a metered dose inhaler (MDI).
PMC5009486,S6,,We examined the lower GP MDI dose range to determine an optimal dose for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
PMC5009486,S7,,Methods
PMC5009486,S8,,"This randomized, double-blind, chronic-dosing, balanced incomplete-block, placebo-controlled, crossover study compared six doses of GP MDI (18, 9, 4.6, 2.4, 1.2, and 0.6Â Î_g, twice daily [BID]) with placebo MDI BID and open-label tiotropium dry powder inhaler (18Â Î_g, once daily [QD]) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD."
PMC5009486,S9,,Patients were randomized into 1 of 120 treatment sequences.
PMC5009486,S10,,Each sequence included 4 of 8 treatments administered for 14-day periods separated by 7- to 21-day washout periods.
PMC5009486,S11,,The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1Â s area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (FEV1 AUC0â€“12) on Day 14.
PMC5009486,S12,,"Secondary efficacy endpoints included peak change from baseline (post-dose) in FEV1 and inspiratory capacity (IC) on Days 1, 7, and 14; change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 on Days 7 and 14; change from baseline in 12-h post-dose trough FEV1 on Day 14; time to onset of action (â‰¥10Â % improvement in mean FEV1) and the proportion of patients achieving â‰¥12Â % improvement in FEV1 on Day 1; and pre-dose trough IC on Days 7 and 14."
PMC5009486,S13,,Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
PMC5009486,S14,,Results
PMC5009486,S15,,"GP MDI 18, 9, 4.6, and 2.4Â Î_g demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant increases in FEV1 AUC0â€“12 compared with placebo MDI following 14Â days of treatment (modified intent-to-treat populationâ€‰=â€‰120)."
PMC5009486,S16,,GP MDI 18Â Î_g was non-inferior to open-label tiotropium for peak change in FEV1 on Day 1 and morning pre-dose trough FEV1 on Day 14.
PMC5009486,S17,,All doses of GP MDI were well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings.
PMC5009486,S18,,Conclusions
PMC5009486,S19,,These efficacy and safety results support GP MDI 18Â Î_g BID as the most appropriate dose for evaluation in Phase III trials in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

PMC5009486,S25,,Background
PMC5009486,S26,,"Symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often treated in a step-wise manner, with guidelines recommending the initiation of maintenance therapy with a long-acting bronchodilator, either a long-acting Î_2-agonist (LABA) or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) [1]."
PMC5009486,S27,,Patients who remain symptomatic require addition of a second long-acting bronchodilator or an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) through a combination of inhalers.
PMC5009486,S28,,The properties associated with different inhalers may make some devices more suitable for certain patient groups than others.
PMC5009486,S29,,"For example, pressurized metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are currently the most commonly used devices overall for respiratory drug delivery [2] and can be used by patients with severe airflow limitation who may struggle to activate a dry powder inhaler (DPI) [3, 4]."
PMC5009486,S30,,"At the time when this study was performed, licensed LAMA and LAMA/LABA fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies in COPD were only available via DPIs or a Soft Mistâ„¢ Inhaler (RespimatÂ®)."
PMC5009486,S31,,"There is therefore an opportunity to widen the choice of inhalers available to patients by developing MDIs that can deliver a LAMA as monotherapy as well as in combination with other agents, such as a LABA and/or an ICS."
PMC5009486,S32,,The requirement for chlorofluorocarbon-free propellant formulated MDIs has proved challenging for the creation of stable formulations and has led to the development of innovative technological advances to overcome these barriers.
PMC5009486,S33,,Co-Suspensionâ„¢ Delivery Technology has evolved such that drug particles can be suspended in hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant by the use of spray-dried porous particles of distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine.
PMC5009486,S34,,"These particles form strong non-specific associations with the drug molecules, preventing the drugs from interacting with each other in the suspension and providing long-term stability."
PMC5009486,S35,,"In analytical studies, these Co-Suspension delivery technology formulations have demonstrated excellent stability and dose uniformity, even in the nanogram dose range, with one, two, and three active ingredients formulated in a single inhaler [5]."
PMC5009486,S36,,"The clinical study reported here is one of a number of studies in a Phase II program that assessed the safety and efficacy of a single-agent LAMA (glycopyrrolate [GP]) MDI, a single-agent LABA (formoterol fumarate [FF]) MDI, and dual LAMA/LABA (GP/FF [GFF]) FDC MDI, all delivered using Co-Suspension delivery technology (NCT00871182 [6], NCT01350128 [7], NCT01085045 [8], NCT01587079 [9], and NCT01349868 [10])."
PMC5009486,S37,,"The LAMA, GP, delivered using Co-Suspension delivery technology as GP MDI, has demonstrated bronchodilator effects across a dose range of 4.6â€“36Â Î_g in patients with COPD (NCT01350128 [7])."
PMC5009486,S38,,"However, to confirm the optimum dose of GP MDI, there is a requirement to further characterize the doseâ€“response relationship below GP MDI 4.6Â Î_g."
PMC5009486,S39,,This study is the first assessment of the lower end of the doseâ€“response curve for GP MDI.
PMC5009486,S40,,"This is a randomized, double-blind, chronic-dosing, placebo-controlled, multicenter crossover study to establish the doseâ€“response curve for the GP MDI (18, 9, 4.6, 2.4, 1.2, and 0.6Â Î_g administered twice daily [BID]) monotherapy."
PMC5009486,S41,,The aim is to provide additional support for the selection of the optimal dose of GP MDI to carry forward in studies investigating the LAMA/LABA MDI FDC in patients with COPD.

PMC5009486,S146,,Discussion
PMC5009486,S147,,The results of this study identified GP 18Â Î_g as the optimal dose that demonstrated the greatest efficacy versus placebo MDI with no accompanying increase in AEs.
PMC5009486,S148,,"These results enabled the selection of GP 18Â Î_g BID as the most appropriate dose of GP, formulated using Co-Suspension delivery technology delivered via MDI, to take forward into Phase III clinical trials."
PMC5009486,S149,,"As Co-Suspension delivery technology enables uniform and reliable delivery of very low doses of GP via the MDI device [5], this study is the first to have characterized the actual doseâ€“response curve of GP using a sub-microgram dose, which previously could not be formulated either as a MDI or a DPI."
PMC5009486,S150,,"GP MDI 18Â Î_g was generally the most effective dose versus placebo MDI, with a clear dose response from 0.6Â Î_g to 4.6Â Î_g, followed by a relatively flat doseâ€“response curve at the higher doses."
PMC5009486,S151,,The primary endpoint for this study was FEV1 AUC0â€“12 at Day 14 relative to baseline.
PMC5009486,S152,,"While this represents the full efficacy profile for GP MDI, this endpoint only represents the first half of the efficacy profile for tiotropium DPI, where the magnitude of effect in the second 12Â h has been shown to be smaller [16â€“20]."
PMC5009486,S153,,"Nonetheless, non-inferiority was defined as a lower 95Â % CI boundâ€‰â‰¥âˆ’100Â mL relative to open-label tiotropium for the primary endpoint, FEV1 AUC0â€“12 at Day 14 relative to baseline."
PMC5009486,S154,,"The value of 100Â mL was selected based on ATS/European Respiratory Society task force recommendations and studies that suggest this is the minimum difference required for clinical relevance, defined as the smallest difference in FEV1 that is perceived by patients as important [15, 21]."
PMC5009486,S155,,"For the primary endpoint, a doseâ€“response was observed across GP MDI doses, with GP MDI 18Â Î_g demonstrating the largest benefit (158Â mL), with even the lower bound of the 95Â % CI (107Â mL, 208Â mL) exceeding the minimum clinically important difference."
PMC5009486,S156,,"Despite this robust and clinically meaningful finding, no dose of GP MDI was statistically non-inferior to open-label tiotropium for the primary endpoint on Day 14."
PMC5009486,S157,,"We observed a higher-than-expected response with tiotropium, with a response versus placebo MDI for the primary endpoint of 224Â mL, compared with 107 and 199Â mL observed in Phase III studies at Week 12 and Week 6, respectively [17, 20]."
PMC5009486,S158,,"Whilst a peak FEV1 of approximately 360Â mL was observed for open-label tiotropium on Days 7 and 14 of this trial, previous studies have reported lower values for this endpoint, ranging from 240 to 280Â mL [22, 23]."
PMC5009486,S159,,Perhaps noteworthy with respect to the large tiotropium response was that the tiotropium group in this study also demonstrated the largest airway reversibility at baseline.
PMC5009486,S160,,GP MDI 18Â Î_g consistently demonstrated superiority to placebo MDI for the secondary efficacy endpoints.
PMC5009486,S161,,"GP MDI showed an early onset of action, with a peak effect 1â€“2 h post-dose, followed by a gradual decrease in effect over 12Â h, supporting the use of BID dosing."
PMC5009486,S162,,"Night-time and early-morning symptoms have been reported as a common occurrence in patients with COPD [24, 25], with sleep disturbance linked to poorer outcomes including high exacerbation frequency and poor survival [26, 27]."
PMC5009486,S163,,"Bronchodilator efficacy is therefore required in the second half of the 24-h dosing period, and further studies are required to investigate the benefits conferred by BID delivery of GP MDI through a second peak of bronchodilation in the evening, in particular versus tiotropium QD where the magnitude of effect in the second 12Â h has been shown to be smaller [16â€“20]."
PMC5009486,S164,,Conclusions
PMC5009486,S165,,"In conclusion, in this dose-ranging study evaluating single-agent GP MDI formulated using Co-Suspension delivery technology at doses of 0.6â€“18Â Î_g, GP 18Â Î_g demonstrated a robust and clinically relevant benefit compared with placebo MDI and is the most appropriate dose of GP MDI BID to take forward into Phase III clinical trials."

PMC5033259,S2,,"Lorcaserin Administration Decreases Activation of Brain Centers in Response to Food Cues and These Emotion- and Salience-Related Changes Correlate With Weight Loss Effects: A 4-Week-Long Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Clinical Trial"
PMC5033259,S3,,Abstract
PMC5033259,S4,,Lorcaserin is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2c receptor agonist effective in treating obesity.
PMC5033259,S5,,"Studies in rodents have shown that lorcaserin acts in the brain to exert its weight-reducing effects, but this has not yet been studied in humans."
PMC5033259,S6,,"We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with 48 obese participants and used functional MRI to study the effects of lorcaserin on the brain."
PMC5033259,S7,,Subjects taking lorcaserin had decreased brain activations in the attention-related parietal and visual cortices in response to highly palatable food cues at 1 week in the fasting state and in the parietal cortex in response to any food cues at 4 weeks in the fed state.
PMC5033259,S8,,"Decreases in emotion- and salience-related limbic activity, including the insula and amygdala, were attenuated at 4 weeks."
PMC5033259,S9,,"Decreases in caloric intake, weight, and BMI correlated with activations in the amygdala, parietal, and visual cortices at baseline."
PMC5033259,S10,,"These data suggest that lorcaserin exerts its weight-reducing effects by decreasing attention-related brain activations to food cues (parietal and visual cortices) and emotional and limbic activity (insula, amygdala)."
PMC5033259,S11,,Results indicating that baseline activation of the amygdala relates to increased efficacy suggest that lorcaserin would be of particular benefit to emotional eaters.
PMC5033259,S12,,Introduction
PMC5033259,S13,,"Obesity is a growing problem in industrialized countries, where approximately one-third of the population is obese, and has been associated with a number of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, different types of cancer, and decreased life expectancy (1)."
PMC5033259,S14,,"Thus, there is a clear need for the development of new treatments for obesity."
PMC5033259,S15,,"One such recent treatment is lorcaserin, a selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2c (5-HT2c) receptor agonist."
PMC5033259,S16,,"Previous use of serotonergic agonists, such as fenfluramine, was linked to nonselective activation of 5-HT2 receptors that led to various cardiac problems (2)."
PMC5033259,S17,,"However, because a 5-HT2c receptor antagonist blocked the weight-reducing effects of fenfluramine, the more selective activation of 5-HT2c receptors by lorcaserin would produce this antiobesity benefit seemingly without cardiac risk (3)."
PMC5033259,S18,,"Knockout mice for the 5-HT2c receptors have a higher body weight as a result of abnormal food consumption, further confirming the role of this receptor in obesity (4)."
PMC5033259,S19,,"These animals exhibit changes in metabolic hormones, developing insulin and leptin resistance and, moreover, impaired glucose tolerance in addition to prolonged meal duration and frequency (4,5)."
PMC5033259,S20,,"A similar mechanism may contribute to the significant improvement in the levels of fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure seen in patients treated with lorcaserin (6â€“8)."
PMC5033259,S21,,"5-HT2c receptors are located almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS), including the thalamus and hypothalamus, areas that are known to be involved in feeding regulation, but also in more cortical areas involved in higher thought and top-down processes (9â€“11)."
PMC5033259,S22,,"Activation of 5-HT2c receptors in the rodent brain, predominantly in the hypothalamus, initiates a cascade that stimulates release of Î±-melanocortinâˆ’stimulating hormone, which acts on melanocortin-4 receptors to regulate appetite (12â€“14)."
PMC5033259,S23,,"This pathway may also activate cortical areas, because there is evidence of melanocortin-4 receptors acting in the cortex of mice to reduce food intake (15,16)."
PMC5033259,S24,,The exact mechanisms underlying weight loss from lorcaserin have not yet been fully elucidated in humans.
PMC5033259,S25,,"Several large studies have demonstrated that lorcaserin is an effective weight-loss agent, with total body mass loss averaging greater than 5% (6,17), but significant interindividual variability exists in the magnitude of the weight lost."
PMC5033259,S26,,"Because 5-HT2c receptors are a novel target for obesity, further work is required to determine whether the weight-reducing effects of lorcaserin are caused by actions in the CNS, and if yes, which specific brain centers are involved."
PMC5033259,S27,,"Furthermore, whether there are CNS centers whose activation may predict which individuals respond the most to lorcaserin, and thus provide additional clinical insight, is not yet known."
PMC5033259,S28,,"We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to examine potential CNS targets for lorcaserin by using functional MRI (fMRI) to study how lorcaserin alters brain center activations in response to food images in the short-term (1 week) and longer-term (4 weeks)."
PMC5033259,S29,,"In addition, we explored how individual differences in the brainâ€™s response to food cues at baseline may predict the magnitude of future weight loss and decreased caloric intake with lorcaserin therapy."

PMC5033259,S57,,fMRI Protocol and Analysis
PMC5033259,S79,,Results
PMC5033259,S80,,"The study enrolled 48 participants, of whom 24 were assigned to placebo (11 women and 13 men; age, 49.4 Â± 2.7 years) and 24 were assigned to lorcaserin (14 women and 11 men; age, 45.5 Â± 3.0 years)."
PMC5033259,S81,,There were no significant differences in sex (P < 0.386) or age (P < 0.339).
PMC5033259,S82,,"Of the enrolled 48 participants, 36 completed 4 visits over a 1-month period, of whom 19 were in the placebo group (8 women and 11 men; age, 50.4 Â± 3.1 years) and 17 were in the lorcaserin group (10 women and 7 men; age, 49.6 Â± 2.9 years)."
PMC5033259,S83,,"Reasons for dropout included family emergencies, meeting exclusion criterion at visit 1, unexpected move, and discomfort/claustrophobia in the MRI at visit 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
PMC5033259,S84,,"Headaches were reported as an adverse effect from the medication at 1 week in three patients in the lorcaserin and in one patient in the placebo group, which were not significantly different (Ï‡2 = 1.3932; P < 0.24)."
PMC5033259,S85,,No patients in either group reported headaches at 4 weeks.
PMC5033259,S86,,No patients in either group reported cognitive impairments at any time during the study.
PMC5033259,S87,,"Suicidality, as measured by a physician with the MSSI, was 0 for all patients at all time points."
PMC5033259,S88,,"Participants did show a significant difference in BMI at baseline, despite randomization (t34 = 3.11; P < 0.004)."
PMC5033259,S89,,"Thus, baseline BMI was controlled in subsequent analyses."
PMC5033259,S90,,"Although participants did not show weight loss at 1 week, they did show significant BMI reductions in the lorcaserin group at 4 weeks (P < 0.006) (Table 1)."
PMC5033259,S91,,"Total caloric intake decreased over time in the lorcaserin group (week 1: 2,085 Â± 224 kcal/day; week 4: 1,551 Â± 266 kcal/day) compared with the placebo group (week 1: 1,940 Â± 202 kcal/day; week 4: 2,106 Â± 244 kcal/day; P < 0.015)."
PMC5033259,S92,,"Clinical and metabolic outcomes similarly improved, as expected, in response to lorcaserin treatment (Table 1)."
PMC5033259,S93,,There were no differences in neurocognitive testing between the two groups (Table 1).
PMC5033259,S94,,Similar results were observed with intention-to-treat analyses (anthropometric data reported in Table 2).
PMC5033259,S95,,Changes in Brain Activations With Lorcaserin Over Time
PMC5033259,S96,,There were no functional differences between the two groups at baseline with a two-sample t test.
PMC5033259,S97,,"Using a factorial design, we observed that after 1 week in the fasting state, participants who received lorcaserin showed less activation in the cuneus, precuneus, temporoparietal junction, and the occipital cortex to highly palatable compared with less palatable food cues (Table 3 and Fig. 1A)."
PMC5033259,S98,,There were no changes for all food cues compared with nonfood images at 1 week.
PMC5033259,S99,,"We observed that after 4 weeks in the fed state, participants who received lorcaserin showed less activation in the parietal cortex (Table 3 and Fig. 1B); no significant differences were found at 4 weeks in the fasting state."
PMC5033259,S100,,There were no changes for highly desirable compared with less desirable food cues at 4 weeks.
PMC5033259,S101,,"In a comparison of short- and long-term (1 vs. 4 weeks) treatment, participants who received lorcaserin showed less activations in the insula, parietal cortex, visual cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala in the fasting state at 1 week than at 4 weeks, suggesting attenuation at 4 weeks (Table 3 and Fig. 1C)."
PMC5033259,S102,,"There were no differences in activation for the hypothalamus, as was suggested by previous studies in rodents to be the site of action for lorcaserin in the brain, but this, similar to prior studies in humans, may have been caused by artifacts in the fMRI and/or its small size (see discussion)."

PMC5033259,S108,,"Changes in the visual cortices in the fasting state to highly desirable compared with less desirable food cues at week 1â€“week 0 also correlated with changes in BMI (r = 0.35, P < 0.039)."
PMC5033259,S109,,Reported changes in caloric intake did not significantly correlate with changes in brain activations.
PMC5033259,S110,,"When we examine those individuals in the lorcaserin group, changes in activation in the cuneus between week 1 and week 0 in the fasting state to highly desirable compared with less desirable food cues correlated with changes in BMI at 4 weeks (r = 0.58, P < 0.014)."
PMC5033259,S111,,"Changes in the parietal cortices in the fasting state to highly desirable compared with less desirable food cues at week 1â€“week 4 also correlated with changes in BMI (r = 0.57, P < 0.016)."
PMC5033259,S112,,"Changes in caloric intake correlated with changes in the visual and parietal cortices and insula at week 1â€“week 0 (r = 0.64, P < 0.005; r = 0.53, P < 0.029; r = 0.70, P < 0.002, respectively) and with changes in the precuneus, temporoparietal junction, visual and parietal cortices, and insula at week 1â€“week 4 (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001; r = 0.88, P < 0.0001; r = 0.86, P < 0.0001; r = 0.77, P < 0.0001; r = 0.67, P < 0.003, respectively)."
PMC5033259,S113,,Baseline Predictors of Efficacy With Lorcaserin
PMC5033259,S114,,"To determine whether there are baseline predictors of the efficacy of lorcaserin, we performed whole-brain regressions with baseline brain activations to food cues and the metrics of efficacy, including weight loss, decreases in BMI, and decreases in caloric intake."
PMC5033259,S115,,"Greater weight lost at 4 weeks is correlated with activation of the amygdala to highly desirable compared with less desirable food cues during the fed state in a regression analysis on the brain of the patients who received lorcaserin (n = 17) at baseline (cluster size = 2,663 mm3; peak at âˆ’20, âˆ’10, âˆ’18; z = 4.58) (Fig. 2A)."
PMC5033259,S116,,"Activations in visual cortices of the occipital lobe during the fed state to highly desirable compared with less desirable food images correlate significantly with decreases in BMI (cluster size = 40,200 mm3; peak at 8, âˆ’38, âˆ’4; z = 4.45) (Fig. 2B), as well as the amygdala, which does not reach a corrected threshold (cluster size = 2,438 mm3; peak at âˆ’18, âˆ’8, âˆ’16; z = 3.55)."
PMC5033259,S117,,"For participants on lorcaserin who submitted their detailed food logs (n = 13), we observe that baseline activation in the prefrontal cortex to all food images compared with nonfood images during the fed state indicating lower baseline activations are associated with more decreases in total caloric consumption (cluster size = 13,069 mm3; peak at âˆ’6, 58, 10; z = 4.26) (Fig. 2C)."

PMC5033259,S120,,"Greater activation of areas shown in red at baseline (week 0) are correlated with greater weight loss, BMI decreases, or decreases in caloric intake at 4 weeks."
PMC5033259,S121,,"BOLD contrasts are superimposed on a T1 structural image in axial sections from z = âˆ’15 to z = 60, in neurological orientation."
PMC5033259,S122,,Discussion
PMC5033259,S123,,We report decreases in brain activations to food cues with relatively short-term (1 week) and longer-term (4 weeks) therapy with lorcaserin.
PMC5033259,S124,,"More specifically, we report deactivations with lorcaserin at 1 week during the fasting state and before weight loss with decreased attention-related parietal and visual activations to highly desirable food cues."
PMC5033259,S125,,"In a direct comparison between 1 and 4 weeks, we see significant decreases with lorcaserin at 1 week to highly desirable food cues in attention-related brain areas and the amygdala compared with the longer-term 4-week time point, indicating attenuation of deactivations by lorcaserin over time."
PMC5033259,S126,,"After 4 weeks and modest weight loss, we report decreases in the attention-related parietal cortex in the fed state."
PMC5033259,S127,,"When baseline predictors of success with lorcaserin were examined, weight loss at 4 weeks correlated with baseline activation of amygdala, part of the emotional/limbic system, to highly desirable food cues after a meal in a whole-brain regression analysis, suggesting that increased activation of the amygdala indicates which participants would benefit most from the use of lorcaserin."
PMC5033259,S128,,"Decreases in BMI correlated with amygdala and occipital activations at baseline for the lorcaserin group in the fed state, suggesting that lorcaserin may be helpful for individuals who find highly desirable and less healthful food cues more salient."
PMC5033259,S129,,"Decreases in total caloric consumption correlated inversely with activations in the prefrontal cortex to all food cues compared with nonfood cues during the fed state, suggesting poorer baseline cognitive control may suggest later benefit of lorcaserin on reported caloric consumption."
PMC5033259,S130,,"Altogether, our findings suggest that lorcaserin decreases cortical and limbic activations to food cues over time, with greater effects in the short-term or 1 week."
PMC5033259,S131,,"Furthermore, the regressions with changes in weight and BMI suggest that lorcaserin may be of the most benefit to emotional eaters or those who have dysfunctional activations at baseline."
PMC5033259,S132,,Changes in Brain Activations With Lorcaserin Over Time
PMC5033259,S133,,"At 1 week, we observe decreased activation in the parietal cortex, cuneus, precuneus, and visual cortices to highly desirable food cues."
PMC5033259,S134,,"These areas are involved in many cognitive processes but may be representing changes in attention and saliency; that is, attending to cues of relative importance, processing, indicating that short-term treatment with lorcaserin decreases the importance and attention to highly palatable foods."
PMC5033259,S135,,"In the fasting state, activations of areas involved in salience and attention to high-calorie compared with low-calorie food cues have been previously observed in participants without obesity because these are generally more attention-grabbing foods (21)."
PMC5033259,S136,,"Other studies have also shown similarly increased activation in the occipital cortex for food images (22,23)."
PMC5033259,S137,,"These typically increased activations are due to the inherent importance and emotional value of food cues; indeed, others have shown that higher occipital lobe activation is linked with exposure to emotional images (24,25)."
PMC5033259,S138,,The parietal cortex is a well-known component of the attention and salience system that increases activity to important stimuli (26â€“28).
PMC5033259,S139,,"Thus, our data indicate that highly desirable food cues appear less important with lorcaserin treatment."
PMC5033259,S140,,"Altogether, these results suggest that lorcaserin decreases the emotional significance of highly desirable food cues, which leads to the observed decrease in food consumption."
PMC5033259,S141,,"Regarding changes over time, we report attenuation of brain deactivations between 1 and 4 weeks of lorcaserin therapy, where there is less deactivation of attention-related circuitry at 4 weeks than at 1 week."
PMC5033259,S142,,"Indeed, a direct comparison showed the same visual and parietal cortices as well as the insula and amygdala, which may also be involved in the saliency network, are more deactivated at 1 week than at 4 weeks for lorcaserin compared with placebo."
PMC5033259,S143,,"Among their involvement in other CNS systems, the insula and amygdala are both involved in salience and emotional processing (29â€“33)."
PMC5033259,S144,,"Although the insula is also involved in proprioception and taste (34), its activation in this study could be related to salience or to changes in gut motility and cue priming to involve the enteric nervous system resulting from the posterior location of the activation (35)."
PMC5033259,S145,,"This relative increase between 1 and 4 weeks may represent attenuation at 4 weeks, where brain activations begin to return to control/baseline levels."
PMC5033259,S146,,"Indeed, at 4 weeks compared with baseline, we observe only decreased activation of the parietal cortex to food cues, regardless of desirability, in the fed state."
PMC5033259,S147,,"This likely demonstrates a continued decreasing â€œvalueâ€ù of food cues with lorcaserin treatment in the longer-term, which has become less pronounced or attenuated over time."
PMC5033259,S148,,"Unlike studies with rodents, we did not observe any changes in hypothalamic activation with lorcaserin (9â€“11)."
PMC5033259,S149,,Rodents and humans have a different brain structure.
PMC5033259,S150,,"Eating behaviors in rodents are primarily controlled by the homeostatic system (hypothalamus), and the rodent cortex is not comparable in structure or function to the cortex controlling food intake in humans."
PMC5033259,S151,,"Indeed, in humans, eating is often controlled by higher cortical processes, including reward, saliency, and other networks, and not simply the homeostatic processes of the hypothalamus (36)."
PMC5033259,S152,,"The lack of a finding in the hypothalamus may also be due to the limitations of fMRI, because the hypothalamus is small and susceptible to artifacts from its proximity to the sinuses (36)."
PMC5033259,S153,,"Thus, hypothalamic activation by lorcaserin should not be ruled out but cannot be confirmed from this fMRI study in humans."
PMC5033259,S154,,"It could be argued that differences in brain activations over time may indicate confounding effects, such as interacting changes with weight loss over time and/or habituation to the effects of the medication."
PMC5033259,S155,,That patients could have habituated to the task over time is also possible.
PMC5033259,S156,,"Considering that participants in the placebo group had the same number of fMRI scans, these potential confounders should have been adequately controlled."
PMC5033259,S157,,Baseline Predictors of Efficacy With Lorcaserin
PMC5033259,S158,,"Given the variability of responses to lorcaserin in the clinic and to determine predictors of efficacy with lorcaserin, we performed whole-brain regression analyses of baseline activations with metrics of clinical success, including weight loss, BMI changes, and caloric intake."
PMC5033259,S159,,"We observed that the activation of the amygdala at baseline in response to highly desirable food cues, an indicator of emotional eating, correlated with greater weight lost at 4 weeks."
PMC5033259,S160,,"The amygdala is a component of the saliency network, particularly responding to emotionally salient stimuli (31â€“33), that has also been implicated directly in the emotional eating system (37,38)."
PMC5033259,S161,,"Thus, individuals who find highly palatable foods emotionally more salient would be the ones to mainly obtain the most weight loss/change in brain activations over time when treated with lorcaserin."
PMC5033259,S162,,"This also indicates that lorcaserin may be most helpful for individuals who are emotional eaters and will need to be confirmed with further studies, including not only fMRIs but also questionnaires specific for emotional eating."
PMC5033259,S163,,"In addition, we report that decreases in BMI correlate not only with activation of the amygdala but also with occipital activations at baseline for the lorcaserin group in the fed state."
PMC5033259,S164,,This provides further support for the notion that lorcaserin may be helpful for individuals who find highly desirable and less healthful food cues more salient.
PMC5033259,S165,,"Furthermore, prefrontal activation during the fed state to all food cues compared with nonfood cues correlates inversely with decreases in total caloric consumption."
PMC5033259,S166,,"Prefrontal activations may indicate a number of cognitive processes, including emotion, salience, memory, and top-down processes (39)."
PMC5033259,S167,,"Most frequently with regards to food cues, prefrontal activations are thought to be related to cognitive control and to an individualâ€™s ability to stop him- or herself from eating in excess or eating unhealthy foods (29,40,41)."
PMC5033259,S168,,"Thus, individuals who had less cognitive controlâ€“related prefrontal activations at baseline showed less decreases in caloric intake, indicating that participants who already have less cortical inhibition to food cues receive the greatest benefit from lorcaserin in food consumption."
PMC5033259,S169,,"This is a plausible hypothesis, because these individuals would have the most room for improvement."
PMC5033259,S170,,This needs to be tested by future specifically designed studies focusing on emotional eaters and any differences in the efficacy and brain responses to food with lorcaserin.
PMC5033259,S171,,"Strengths, Limitations, and Other Considerations"
PMC5033259,S172,,"Although we do not observe any changes in cognition with up to 1 month of lorcaserin treatment, animal studies suggest that there may be cognitive benefits."
PMC5033259,S173,,"Whether the effects observed previously in mice were a result of changes in body weight or the medication per se remain unclear, because they are not confirmed in our study with participants on the medication before significant weight loss."
PMC5033259,S174,,"A prior study in mice demonstrated decreased spatial/working memory with diet-induced obesity, which was improved with lorcaserin therapy (42), but this may simply highlight effects of weight loss or simply the differences between rodent and human brains."
PMC5033259,S175,,"Weight loss itself typically results in improved performance on cognitive tasks in humans, including memory and executive function (43,44)."
PMC5033259,S176,,"Because we do not observe any changes on cognition with lorcaserin in this study, this may indicate that any longer-term benefits may be the result of weight loss and not the medication itself and/or that such changes may be weaker or take longer to manifest in humans."
PMC5033259,S177,,Longer-term studies would be required to determine whether this might be the case.
PMC5033259,S178,,One could argue that it is a limitation of the study that our randomization did not eliminate differences in BMI between the two groups at baseline.
PMC5033259,S179,,"However, we controlled for such baseline differences in our analyses and observed no differences in brain activations to food cues between the two groups at baseline."
PMC5033259,S180,,"One would also question, given that no prior data exist on which to base power calculations, whether an adequate number of participants was included."
PMC5033259,S181,,"The number of participants was similar to recent studies with other medications and MRI (45,46)."
PMC5033259,S182,,"Furthermore, although we have examined multiple fMRI contrasts over time, we report results that reach a threshold corrected for multiple comparisons with FWE corrections, according to the standard with fMRI studies."
PMC5033259,S183,,"Thus, multiple comparisons should not have affected our findings."
PMC5033259,S184,,"Studies of longer duration would also be warranted to look at continued success and longer-term effects on food cue processing, such as at 12 weeks, when weight loss is expected to plateau."
PMC5033259,S185,,"Indeed, studies have shown that weight loss by week 12 with lorcaserin is a strong predictor of longer-term (52 weeks) success (47), which may indicate a good time at which to determine individual differences in response to lorcaserin."
PMC5033259,S186,,"Overall, these results are strong and indicate clear changes in brain responses to food cues with lorcaserin therapy."
PMC5033259,S187,,"In addition, we observe baseline differences in activation that correlate to behavioral changes in response to lorcaserin and that may suggest that lorcaserin is of particular benefit to individuals who are emotional eaters and/or place importance on high-calorie or high-fat foods."
PMC5033259,S188,,"This is of particular importance in the clinic, given the variable responses observed to lorcaserin therapy."
PMC5033259,S189,,"If confirmed and correlated with appropriately designed questionnaire data, these findings can not only provide mechanistic explanations but also lead to developments of clinical tools to select which individuals would respond best clinically to treatment with lorcaserin."

PMC5064025,S2,,Arterial Effects of Canakinumab in PatientsÂ With Atherosclerosis and TypeÂ 2Â Diabetes or Glucose Intolerance
PMC5064025,S3,,Abstract
PMC5064025,S4,,Background
PMC5064025,S5,,Evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-1Î_ is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications and that inhibiting IL-1Î_ may favorably affect vascular disease progression.
PMC5064025,S6,,Objectives
PMC5064025,S7,,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of IL-1Î_ inhibition with canakinumab versus placebo on arterial structure and function, determined by magnetic resonance imaging."
PMC5064025,S8,,Methods
PMC5064025,S9,,Patients (NÂ = 189) with atherosclerotic disease and either type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to receive placebo (nÂ = 94) or canakinumab 150 mg monthly (nÂ = 95) for 12 months.
PMC5064025,S10,,They underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the carotid arteries and aorta.
PMC5064025,S11,,Results
PMC5064025,S12,,There were no statistically significant differences between canakinumab compared with placebo in the primary efficacy and safety endpoints.
PMC5064025,S13,,"There was no statistically significant change in mean carotid wall area and no effect on aortic distensibility, measured at 3 separate anatomic sites."
PMC5064025,S14,,The change in mean carotid artery wall area was â€“3.37 mm2 after 12 months with canakinumab versus placebo.
PMC5064025,S15,,High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly reduced by canakinumab compared with placebo at 3 months (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 0.568; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.436 to 0.740; pÂ < 0.0001) and 12 months (GMR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.414 to 0.758; pÂ = 0.0002).
PMC5064025,S16,,"Lipoprotein(a) levels were reduced by canakinumab compared with placebo (â€“4.30 mg/dl [range: â€“8.5 to â€“0.55 mg/dl]; pÂ =Â 0.025] at 12 months), but triglyceride levels increased (GMR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.046 to 1.380; pÂ = 0.01)."
PMC5064025,S17,,"In these patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, canakinumab had no effect compared with placebo on any of the measures assessed by using a standard oral glucose tolerance test."
PMC5064025,S18,,Conclusions
PMC5064025,S19,,There were no statistically significant effects of canakinumab on measures of vascular structure or function.
PMC5064025,S20,,"Canakinumab reduced markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6), and there were modest increases in levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides."
PMC5064025,S21,,(Safety & Effectiveness on Vascular Structure andÂ Function of ACZ885 in Atherosclerosis and Either T2DM or IGT Patients; NCT00995930)
PMC5064025,S22,,"Atherosclerosis is well-established as a disease with an important inflammatory component 1, 2, 3."
PMC5064025,S23,,"Systemic markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A are strongly related to cardiovascular prognosis in various populations and clinical settings 4, 5."
PMC5064025,S24,,"Furthermore, therapeutic interventions that reduce cardiovascular risk have also been associated with a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers 6, 7."
PMC5064025,S25,,"However, whether specifically targeting inflammation reduces cardiovascular risk remains unknown."
PMC5064025,S26,,"Interleukins are important mediators of inflammation, both locally and systemically."
PMC5064025,S27,,"Macrophages are key cellular components of atherosclerotic plaque and produce interleukin (IL)-1Î_ (8), which is also promoted by cellular cholesterol activation of inflammasomes (9)."
PMC5064025,S28,,IL-1Î_ and interleukin-1Î± exert proinflammatory effects that are inhibited by the endogenous antagonist interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA).
PMC5064025,S29,,"Atherosclerosis-prone mice that are deficient in IL-1Î_ develop smaller lesions (10), andÂ administration of IL-1RA reduces early atherogenesis in mice (11)."
PMC5064025,S30,,"IL-1RAâ€“deficient mice have shown increased atherosclerosis (12) and vascular inflammation, associated with destruction of elastic tissuesÂ (13)."
PMC5064025,S31,,"Therefore, given the key role for IL-1Î_ as a mediator of innate immunity and the effects of interleukinÂ inhibition in experimental atherosclerosis, interventions to reduce inflammation through IL-1Î_ have been proposed to treat atherosclerosis."
PMC5064025,S32,,"Although evidence of benefit to vascular disease in humans remain sparse, administration of the IL-1RA anakinra to patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved several measures of vascular function, including aortic distensibility, flow-mediated vasodilation, and coronary flow reserve (14)."
PMC5064025,S33,,"In addition to its key role in vascular disease, IL-1Î_ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)."
PMC5064025,S34,,"IL-1RA expression is reduced inÂ pancreatic islets of patients with T2DM, and high glucose concentrations induce the production of IL-1Î_ in human pancreatic beta cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion, decreased cell proliferation, and apoptosis (15)."
PMC5064025,S35,,Blockade of the interleukin-1 receptor with anakinra improved glycemia and beta-cell secretory function and reduced markers of systemic inflammation in patients with T2DM (16).
PMC5064025,S36,,Patients with T2DM are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (17) and have evidence of both increased plaque inflammation (18) and reduced arterial distensibility (19).
PMC5064025,S37,,"This group might, therefore, derive â€œmetabolicâ€ù and â€œvascularâ€ù benefits from targeting IL-1Î_, including reduced risk of atherothrombotic complications."
PMC5064025,S38,,A human monoclonal anti-human IL-1Î_ antibody of the immunoglobulin G1/k isotype canakinumab functionally neutralizes IL-1Î_ through steric hindrance of its receptor interaction.
PMC5064025,S39,,"It is effective inÂ reducing systemic markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6 (20)."
PMC5064025,S40,,Its effects on cardiovascular outcomes are under investigation in the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) trial (21).
PMC5064025,S41,,"Vascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a precise, highly reproducible, and versatile tool to assess both vascular structure and function at multiple arterial loci 22, 23, 24, 25."
PMC5064025,S42,,"Accordingly, we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to test the effects of IL-1Î_ inhibition, using canakinumab, on: 1) MRI-derived measures of vascular structure and function; 2) measures of diabetes control; and 3) indicators of systemic inflammation in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2DM."

PMC5064025,S145,,"In this placebo-controlled trial in patients with evidence of clinical atherosclerosis and either type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, the IL-1Î_ inhibitor canakinumab reduced measures of inflammation but did not significantly affect measures of vascular structure or function."

PMC5064025,S147,,"In the present randomized clinical trial of IL-1Î_ inhibition in patients with T2DM or IGT, canakinumab 150 mg monthly reduced blood levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP (Central Illustration)."
PMC5064025,S148,,Similar reductions in inflammatory indexes have been reported previously in patients with T2DM (20).
PMC5064025,S149,,"Significantly, given the target population, the present study showed that this effect persists even with near-universal statin use."
PMC5064025,S150,,"Canakinumab had no effect on fasting glucose, HbA1c, or measures of insulin sensitivity."
PMC5064025,S151,,"In common with earlier studies 19, 23, 24, atherosclerosis burden was quantified in the common carotid arteries and the aorta."
PMC5064025,S152,,We found no statistically significant effect of 12 monthsâ€™ treatment with canakinumab on magnetic resonanceâ€“derived measures of vascular structure or function.
PMC5064025,S153,,"However, in each of the common carotid arteries individually, and in the combined vessel average, there was a suggestion of possible retarded progression of atherosclerotic burden."
PMC5064025,S154,,"Because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, we performed a further analysis, comparing changes in the right and left carotid arteries within individual patients."
PMC5064025,S155,,There were strong relationships between changes in the left- versus right-sided vessels evident in both the canakinumab and the placebo groups but with a tendency toward progression bilaterally in the placebo group.

PMC5064025,S157,,"Moreover, measurements were made separately on individual slices, but the data presented are for wholeÂ arteries."
PMC5064025,S158,,"Given this high level of analytical stringency, these consistent correlations supported the technical robustness of the measurements."
PMC5064025,S159,,"In common with previous studies, we chose toÂ quantify vessel wall area in the tubular carotid arteries because they are less susceptible to error in serial measurements due to â€œvolume averagingâ€ù effects."

PMC5064025,S168,,"Given the discordance with animal studies, one should also consider the possibility that previously observed beneficial effects of IL-1Î_ inhibition need not have been realized directly at the arterial level."

PMC5099201,S4,,Objective
PMC5099201,S5,,To compare the efficacy and safety between tocilizumab added to methotrexate and tocilizumab switched from methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
PMC5099201,S6,,Methods
PMC5099201,S7,,"This is a 2-year randomised, controlled study."
PMC5099201,S8,,RA patients with moderate or high disease activity despite methotrexate were randomly assigned either to tocilizumab added to methotrexate (add-on) or tocilizumab switched from methotrexate (switch).
PMC5099201,S9,,The primary endpoint was the DAS28 remission rate at week 24.

PMC5099201,S11,,Results
PMC5099201,S12,,"Of 223 randomised patients, 83% completed 52â€…weeks."
PMC5099201,S13,,"DAS28 remission rates at week 24 were 70% for add-on and 55% for switch (p=0.02), but they became comparable at week 52 (72% vs 70%, p=0.86)."
PMC5099201,S14,,"Structural remission rates (mTSSâ‰_0.5) at week 52 were not different (66% vs 64%, p=0.92)."
PMC5099201,S15,,"However, clinically relevant radiographic progression rates (CRRP; mTSSâ‰¥3) tended to be higher with the switch than with the add-on (15% vs 7%, p=0.07)."

PMC5099201,S23,,Introduction
PMC5099201,S24,,The advent of intermittent methotrexate (MTX) and various biologic agents has had such an impact on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that a paradigm shift has emerged towards earlier and more aggressive intervention with the goal of remission.1â€“3
PMC5099201,S25,,"MTX is an anchor drug in the management of RA because of its long-term effectiveness and safety profile,4 but in patients who have responded insufficiently to MTX, adjustment of treatment should be considered, including the introduction of another conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) or a biological DMARD according to the absence/presence of poor prognostic factors.1"
PMC5099201,S26,,"When starting a biological DMARD in MTX-insufficient responders with poor prognostic factors, there are two strategies: one is combining a biological DMARD with MTX, and the other is switching to a biological DMARD from MTX."
PMC5099201,S27,,"While majority of clinical studies provide the favourability of a combination therapy, the switch to a monotherapy is debate for interleukin-6 (IL-6) blocking."
PMC5099201,S28,,"Regarding tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, results from many clinical studies have suggested that the use of TNF inhibitors in combination with MTX is superior to TNF inhibitor monotherapy, and that adding TNF inhibitors to MTX is better than replacing MTX with TNF inhibitors in efficacy, while the safety is comparable among the groups.5â€“7"
PMC5099201,S29,,"Tocilizumab (TCZ), humanised antihuman IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been proven to be efficacious in RA patients, and its efficacy has been well validated, both as a combination therapy with MTX and as monotherapy."
PMC5099201,S30,,"TCZ monotherapy has been shown to be more efficacious than MTX monotherapy in MTX-naÃ¯ve patients, in patients with an inadequate response to MTX and in patients with a history of MTX treatment more than 6â€…months before.8â€“10"
PMC5099201,S31,,"Therefore, a question arises if addition of TCZ to MTX or a switch from MTX to TCZ is comparable."
PMC5099201,S32,,The ACT-RAY study was designed as a 3-year trial to compare adding TCZ to switching to TCZ in inadequate responders to MTX.
PMC5099201,S33,,"In that study, no clinically relevant superiority of the addition of TCZ to MTX over the switch to TCZ monotherapy was proven, but there was a modest difference favouring the addition strategy in achieving low disease activity at week 24 and in suppressing radiographic progression at week 52.11 12"
PMC5099201,S34,,"The present 2-year study, the Success of Tocilizumab in RA Patients With Remission Induction and Sustained Efficacy After Discontinuation (SURPRISE) study, was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of adding TCZ to MTX or switching MTX to TCZ in patients with moderate or high disease activity despite MTX treatment during the first 52â€…weeks and subsequently to determine if maintenance of remission after discontinuation of TCZ is possible between weeks 52 and 104."

PMC5099201,S79,,"Remission rates according to the SDAI and the CDAI were not significantly different between the two groups but showed a similar tendency (see online supplementary figure A, B)."
PMC5099201,S80,,"For other endpoints, including Boolean remission and ACR20/50/70, the differences between the two treatment groups were not significant, but there was a trend towards superiority of TCZ added to MTX to TCZ switched from MTX (figure 2B, C, see online supplementary table)."
PMC5099201,S81,,"Although the week 8 visit was not compulsory, data were collected for 55% of the patients and analysed."
PMC5099201,S82,,"The DAS28-ESR remission rate was also significantly higher in the ADD-ON group at week 8 (see online supplementary figure C), and this corroborated the finding that TCZ added to MTX was favourable for the 24â€…weeks."

PMC5099201,S90,,"Clinically relevant radiographic progression (CRRP), defined as change in mTSS from baseline â‰¥3, was observed in 7 patients (7%) in the ADD-ON group and 15 (15%) in the SWITCH group."

PMC5099201,S98,,"To examine the relationship between the achievement of DAS28-ESR remission at week 24 and the CRRP (figure 3B), the patients were divided into four groups: remission at both weeks 24 and 52 (68 in the ADD-ON group and 50 in the SWITCH group); remission at week 24 but non-remission at week 52 (6 in both groups); non-remission at week 24 but remission at week 52 (9 in the ADD-ON group and 23 in the SWITCH group); and non-remission at weeks 24 and 52 (12 in the ADD-ON group and 19 in the SWITCH group)."
PMC5099201,S99,,"The proportion of CRRP patients was the lowest in the group with remission at both weeks 24 and 52, and significantly less than the group with non-remission at week 24 but remission at week 52 and the group with non-remission at weeks 24 and 52 (5.9% vs 18.8%, p=0.02; 5.9% vs 25.8%, p=0.001, respectively)."
PMC5099201,S100,,"The group with remission at week 24 but non-remission at week 52 showed a comparable percentage of CRRP patients as the group with remission at both weeks 24 and 52, implying that non-remission at week 24 contributed chiefly to rapid radiological progression."
PMC5099201,S101,,"In addition, the CRRP patients included nearly twice as many SWITCH patients as ADD-ON patients, supporting the idea that the add-on strategy is a good strategy for preventing radiological progression."
PMC5099201,S102,,"Inflammation status using CRP was further analysed through the study of the CRRP patients, who had higher disease activity than those who responded well to TCZ (figure 3C)."
PMC5099201,S103,,"The mean CRP of the CRRP patients for 52â€…weeks was much higher in the SWITCH group than in the ADD-ON group (1.27 vs 0.37, p=0.03)."
PMC5099201,S104,,"The difference in the mean CRP between the two groups was significant for the first 24â€…weeks (1.56 vs 0.49, p=0.001) but not for the second 28â€…weeks (0.10 vs 0.04, p=0.1), suggesting that less radiographic progression in TCZ added to MTX was attributable to the degree inflammation was suppressed during the first 24â€…weeks of the study."
PMC5099201,S105,,Safety
PMC5099201,S106,,The safety results are presented in table 2.
PMC5099201,S107,,"Overall, the number of patients with at least one AE was greater in the ADD-ON group than in the SWITCH group (60.0% vs 45.0%, p=0.02), but the percentage of patients with at least one serious AE was comparable in the two treatment groups (13.9% vs 8.1%, p=0.20)."
PMC5099201,S108,,"AEs occurring more in the ADD-ON group than in the SWITCH group were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and liver dysfunction."
PMC5099201,S109,,Eleven patients (9.6%) in the ADD-ON group and 4 (3.6%) in the SWITCH group were withdrawn from the study because of AEs (p=0.11).

PMC5099201,S112,,Discussion
PMC5099201,S113,,"This study compared two different strategies in patients with RA with inadequate responses to MTX, and the results suggest that TCZ added to MTX is clinically and radiographically superior to TCZ switched from MTX."
PMC5099201,S114,,"The switch strategy was able to catch up later to the add-on protocol with respect to clinical efficacy, but the structural damage progressed more in a year with the switch therapy."
PMC5099201,S115,,TCZ monotherapy as well as TCZ in combination with MTX has been proven to be more efficacious than MTX monotherapy.8â€“10 13 14
PMC5099201,S116,,The ACT-RAY study comparing the efficacy and safety of TCZ in combination with MTX with TCZ monotherapy in a similar fashion to the present study showed no clinically relevant superiority of the add-on strategy over the switch strategy at 1â€…year and suggested that TCZ monotherapy is a valuable treatment in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX.11 12
PMC5099201,S117,,"However, a modest difference favouring the add-on strategy in achieving low disease activity at week 24 and in suppressing radiographic progression at week 52 was observed."
PMC5099201,S118,,The present study underlined the trends showing the clinical superiority of the combination therapy for the first half of the follow-up period and radiological superiority at 1â€…year.
PMC5099201,S119,,The mean disease duration in the SURPRISE study (3.6â€“3.8â€…years) was shorter than that in the ACT-RAY study (8.2â€“8.3â€…years).
PMC5099201,S120,,"In the ACT-RAY study, conventional DMARDs were added in a patient with a DAS28 >3.2 at week 24."
PMC5099201,S121,,Those differences in patient background and study protocol between the two studies could generate more notable advantageous results of add-on strategy in our study.
PMC5099201,S122,,"The CHARISMA study, in which the combination therapy of TCZ was compared with TCZ monotherapy as a part of a dose-finding phase 2 trial in RA patients who had an incomplete response to MTX, also implied that combination therapy was superior to monotherapy;15 DAS28 remission rates at week 16 in that study were 34% for combination therapy and 17% for monotherapy."
PMC5099201,S123,,"We assume that stopping MTX in conjunction with starting TCZ could transiently increase disease activity, since MTX might have worked to downregulate inflammation to some extent despite the inadequacy."
PMC5099201,S124,,"Importantly, the worse disease activity in patients with TCZ switched from MTX in the first 24â€…weeks impacted radiological outcomes at week 52, despite comparable clinical efficacy at week 52."
PMC5099201,S125,,"This finding was observed in another trial conducted in Japan in which patients completing a 26-week, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab received open-label adalimumab in the following 26â€…weeks."
PMC5099201,S126,,This study showed that the accrual of significant structural damage during 26-week placebo therapy contributed to the persistence of differences in radiographic progression at week 52.16
PMC5099201,S127,,"Taking those findings together with the irreversible nature of the structural damage, TCZ added to MTX was better than TCZ switched from MTX."
PMC5099201,S128,,"Despite the clinical and radiological superiority of TCZ added to MTX, TCZ switched from MTX showed favourable safety outcomes."
PMC5099201,S129,,"While serious AEs were comparable between the two study treatments, AE rates were higher with the add-on strategy than with the switch strategy."
PMC5099201,S130,,"In particular, the add-on strategy resulted in a higher proportion of patients with hepatic disorder."
PMC5099201,S131,,"This was also observed in other TCZ studies,11â€“13 17 suggesting that the combination of TCZ and MTX might have a synergistic effect on the liver."
PMC5099201,S132,,"Nevertheless, the regimen in the combination group in the present study was well tolerated."
PMC5099201,S133,,The fact that the clinical efficacy of SWITCH eventually caught up to that of ADD-ON would be provoking a new strategy: stopping or decreasing MTX after TCZ has made a sufficient contribution.
PMC5099201,S134,,"Aside from the fact that stopping MTX is sometimes necessary because of liver injury or gastrointestinal discomfort, the lymphoproliferative disorder related to long-term use of MTX increasingly poses a serious problem leading us to surmise that minimising the use of MTX is preferable.18â€“20"
PMC5099201,S135,,This should be further examined in future studies.
PMC5099201,S136,,The present study has several limitations.
PMC5099201,S137,,"First, this study was not double-blind, and it cannot be ruled out that knowing the treatment might affect the clinical evaluation."
PMC5099201,S138,,"However, since an objective index such as the mTSS that was assessed by independent blinded readers could detect a difference between the two groups, this effect was likely minimal."
PMC5099201,S139,,"Second, the number of patients enrolled in this study did not reach the sample size defined in advance to prove non-inferiority of TCZ switched from MTX to TCZ added to MTX."
PMC5099201,S140,,"Although the add-on strategy was significantly superior to the switch strategy on the primary endpoint using the DAS28, the superiority in the sensitivity analysis using the SDAI and the CDAI was limited because of the insufficient power."
PMC5099201,S141,,"Third, the dose of MTX used in this study was lower than that used in Western countries, as in the ACT-RAY study."
PMC5099201,S142,,"Since the lower dose of MTX would have tended to decrease the difference between the two groups, this did not appear to have affected the results of the study."
PMC5099201,S143,,"In addition, it has been reported21 that concentration of MTX polyglutamates, a potential marker for MTX use, in red blood cells was relatively higher in a Japanese study than in a study from the USA, suggesting that a lower dose of MTX may be sufficient in Japanese patients."
PMC5099201,S144,,"In conclusion, in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX, TCZ added to MTX suppresses inflammation more than TCZ switched from MTX, leading to superior clinical efficacy and prevention of joint destruction."
PMC5099201,S145,,"While meaningful clinical and radiographic responses were achieved with both strategies, patients could benefit from combination therapy more than monotherapy, although precautions against AEs are necessary."

PMC5264229,S4,,Objectives
PMC5264229,S5,,"To compare the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SB2 to the infliximab reference product (INF) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate therapy."
PMC5264229,S6,,Methods
PMC5264229,S7,,"This is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, multinational, multicentre parallel group study."
PMC5264229,S8,,Patients with moderate to severe RA despite methotrexate therapy were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB2 or INF of 3â€…mg/kg.
PMC5264229,S9,,The primary end point was the American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at week 30.
PMC5264229,S10,,Inclusion of the 95% CI of the ACR20 response difference within a Â±15% margin was required for equivalence.
PMC5264229,S11,,Results
PMC5264229,S12,,584 subjects were randomised into SB2 (N=291; 290 analysed) or INF (N=293).
PMC5264229,S13,,The ACR20 response at week 30 in the per-protocol set was 64.1% in SB2 versus 66.0% in INF.
PMC5264229,S14,,"The adjusted rate difference was âˆ’1.88% (95% CI âˆ’10.26% to 6.51%), which was within the predefined equivalence margin."
PMC5264229,S15,,"Other efficacy outcomes such as ACR50/70, disease activity score measured by 28 joints and European League against Rheumatism response were similar between SB2 and INF."

PMC5264229,S24,,Introduction
PMC5264229,S25,,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that leads to morbidity resulting in high societal costs.1 2
PMC5264229,S26,,"While disease modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate (MTX) have significantly improved the outcome in RA, not all patients respond.3"
PMC5264229,S27,,The advent of biological agents including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of RA;3 4 however the high cost is a significant burden to the patient and society.5
PMC5264229,S28,,A biosimilar is a biologic agent that contains a (similar) version of the active substance of an already authorised original biological medicinal (reference) product.6
PMC5264229,S29,,"Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, biosimilars differ from generic drugs in the chemical drug area.6 7"
PMC5264229,S30,,"Thus, the approval pathway of biosimilars is different from generics; very roughly three major steps are employed.8"
PMC5264229,S31,,"First, a comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation6 is done to prove similarity on the molecular level (including in vivo and in vitro assays), second, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study is done to show bioequivalence, and finally, an efficacy study (usually a randomised controlled study) is done to demonstrate clinical equivalence, compared with the reference product."
PMC5264229,S32,,"The development of Remsima (code name CT-P13, Celltrion, Incheon, Korea), a biosimilar of infliximab (Remicade, Janssen Biotech, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA), has followed this process9â€“11 and recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency.12"
PMC5264229,S33,,The development of biosimilars is anticipated to greatly decrease the economic burden of biological therapy.13
PMC5264229,S34,,SB2 is developed as a biosimilar of infliximab.
PMC5264229,S35,,"SB2 has undergone the stepwise process described above; SB2 was shown to be similar on the molecular level and bioequivalent in normal human subjects in a phase I PK study,14 all compared with the infliximab reference product (INF)."
PMC5264229,S36,,"This study now reports the primary results of the phase III studyâ€”to demonstrate clinical equivalence in patients with moderate to severe RA despite MTX treatment, compared with INF."

PMC5264229,S101,,The median follow-up period was 296â€…days.
PMC5264229,S102,,This data set included all patients that completed the week 30 visit.
PMC5264229,S103,,"Among 805 patients screened, 584 patients were randomised (SB2, N=291 and INF, N=293, figure 1)."
PMC5264229,S104,,"From the SB2 treatment group, one patient was found to be ineligible after randomisation and withdrew before the first infusion."
PMC5264229,S105,,The baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in table 1; the two treatment groups were well-balanced.
PMC5264229,S106,,Two hundred and forty-six patients from the SB2 treatment group and 259 patients from the INF treatment group completed the week 30 visit; the most common reason for withdrawal was due to AEs and withdrawal of consent (figure 1).
PMC5264229,S107,,"Among those who completed week 30, 15 patients (5.2%) from SB2 and 12 patients (4.1%) from INF were excluded from the PPS due to protocol deviations (see online supplementary appendix S4â€“3)."

PMC5264229,S114,,Efficacy
PMC5264229,S115,,The primary efficacy end point ACR20 at week 30 is shown in figure 2.
PMC5264229,S116,,The ACR20 for the PPS was 64.1% for SB2 and 66.0% for INF.
PMC5264229,S117,,"The 95% CI for the rate difference was âˆ’10.26% to 6.51%, which was within the prespecified equivalence margin of Â±15%."
PMC5264229,S118,,"This was also similarly shown in the FAS; ACR20 was 55.5% for SB2 and 59.0% for INF, with the 95% CI âˆ’10.88% to 4.97%."
PMC5264229,S119,,"Thus, the equivalence of SB2 compared with INF was concluded (for unadjusted analyses, see online supplementary appendix S4-1)."
PMC5264229,S120,,Other efficacy outcomes such as ACR50 or ACR70 were also similar in the PPS and FAS (figure 2).
PMC5264229,S121,,"Finally, the ACR20 response over time is shown in figure 3."

PMC5264229,S142,,Safety
PMC5264229,S143,,During the study period 499 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 167 patients (57.6%) in the SB2 treatment group and 529 TEAEs occurred in 170 patients (58.0%) in the INF treatment group (table 2).
PMC5264229,S144,,"The most common TEAEs that occurred were latent TB, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and headache."
PMC5264229,S145,,Most of the TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity.
PMC5264229,S146,,The proportion of TEAEs reported as related to the study drug was low (SB2 21.4% vs INF 20.1%).

PMC5264229,S149,,"Among the TEAEs, 9.0% from SB2 and 8.9% from INF reported at least one serious AE."
PMC5264229,S150,,"There were nine patients (3.1%) from SB2 who developed a serious infection or TB compared with six (2.0%) patients in the INF treatment group (incidence rate: 4.1 cases/100 person-years for SB2 and 2.7 cases/100 person-years for INF), and one event in each treatment group was active TB (table 2)."
PMC5264229,S151,,None of the active TB cases were found to have latent TB at screening.
PMC5264229,S152,,No serious cases of opportunistic infections were reported.
PMC5264229,S153,,There were 28 patients (4.8%) who developed an IRR; 15 (5.2%) from SB2 and 13 (4.4%) from INF reported an IRR.
PMC5264229,S154,,The number of patients who developed IRRs by ADA status were 13 (4.5%) for SB2 and 9 (3.1%) for INF in the ADA-positive subgroup and 2 (0.7%) and 4 (1.4%) in the ADA-negative subgroup.
PMC5264229,S155,,There were no reported cases of delayed hypersensitivity or serum sickness.
PMC5264229,S156,,"There were two cases of malignancies from SB2 (prostate cancer and breast cancer) and one case of heart failure from INF, which was also the only case of death."
PMC5264229,S157,,"Overall, the safety profile was comparable between SB2 and INF."
PMC5264229,S158,,Immunogenicity and PKs
PMC5264229,S159,,"Patients who developed ADA up to week 30 were 55.1% (158/287) in the SB2 treatment group and 49.7% (145/292) in the INF treatment group, which difference was not statistically significant (p=0.212)."
PMC5264229,S160,,The PK results from the PK population are shown in online supplementary appendix S5.
PMC5264229,S161,,"Overall, the Ctrough of infliximab was similar between SB2 and INF over time and was also similar within each ADA subgroup (ADA-positive and ADA-negative) between SB2 and INF (data not shown)."
PMC5264229,S162,,Discussion
PMC5264229,S163,,"The results from this randomised, double-blind study demonstrate the equivalence of efficacy between SB2 and INF as well as the comparability in safety, immunogenicity and PK profiles."
PMC5264229,S164,,"The results are comparable to the previous PLANETRA study,11 which also studied a biosimilar of infliximab in a similar setting."
PMC5264229,S165,,The primary end point ACR20 has been compared in various ways to demonstrate the robustness of equivalence; the results uniformly exhibit the equivalence of ACR20 between SB2 and INF.
PMC5264229,S166,,"In particular, our study has compared the efficacy end points at all visits, and has demonstrated the equivalence of ACR20 response over time, which is an advance over the data presented for the PLANETRA study."
PMC5264229,S167,,"The comparability of efficacy end points over time has been suggested as an important criterion for biosimilarity,27 and our results are supportive in such manner."
PMC5264229,S168,,"It is also notable to observe that other efficacy outcomes besides the ACR response such as DAS28, SDAI, CDAI and EULAR responses all show similarity between SB2 and INF, further supporting the biosimilarity of SB2 to INF."
PMC5264229,S169,,"While results concerning SDAI and CDAI were post hoc analyses, as the components of these indices are all included within the components of ACR20 or DAS28, any bias due to post hoc specifications are expected to be minimal."
PMC5264229,S170,,"In terms of safety, SB2 has demonstrated a comparable safety profile to that of INF; in particular, the incidence of AEs associated with TNF inhibitors such as serious infections, TB, IRRs, malignancies and heart failure were comparable between SB2 and INF."
PMC5264229,S171,,The incidence rate of serious infections or TB was comparable to previous studies.28 29
PMC5264229,S172,,"It is notable that the incidence of TB was low (one case for each treatment group), which universal TB prophylaxis for patients with latent TB at screening might have contributed to."
PMC5264229,S173,,"The incidence of increased ALT levels was higher in SB2 than in INF (7.9% vs 2.7%, table 2), however, patients whose laboratory ALT values with an ALT of 3Ã—ULN (upper limit of normal) and 5Ã—ULN were 5.2% and 1.4%, respectively, for SB2, which are within the historically reported range of ALT abnormalities with INF (2.5â€“9.5% and 0.6â€“3.6%, respectively).30"
PMC5264229,S174,,"Immunogenicity was comparable between SB2 and INF; the incidence of ADA (âˆ_50%) is higher than previous INF pivotal trials4 but comparable with recent INF studies31 32 and PLANETRA (âˆ_48%), probably reflecting the advance of assay technology during the time.11"
PMC5264229,S175,,"The apparent numerical difference was not statistically significant and efficacy was similar within each ADA subgroup (see online supplementary appendix S4-2), a pattern that was also observed in IRRs."
PMC5264229,S176,,The finding that efficacy is lower and the risk of IRRs is higher in ADA-positive patients is consistent with prior experience with infliximab.11 31 32
PMC5264229,S177,,"In ADA-positive patients we observed an approximately 40% higher rate of infusion reactions for SB2 compared with INF; however, among the ADA-negative patients, infusion reactions were twice as high for INF than SB2."
PMC5264229,S178,,The overall rate of infusion reactions was similar with 5.2% for SB2 and 4.4% for INF.
PMC5264229,S179,,Long-term observation will allow further insights into this important aspect.

PMC5418559,S3,,Abstract
PMC5418559,S4,,Objectives:
PMC5418559,S5,,"Tenapanor is a first-in-class, small-molecule inhibitor of the gastrointestinal sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE3."
PMC5418559,S6,,This study assessed the efficacy and safety of tenapanor in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C).
PMC5418559,S7,,Methods:
PMC5418559,S8,,"In this phase 2, double-blind study, patients with IBS-C (Rome III criteria) were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive tenapanor 5â€‰mg, 20â€‰mg, or 50â€‰mg b.i.d., or placebo b.i.d. for 12 weeks."
PMC5418559,S9,,"The primary end point was the complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) responder rate, defined as the proportion of patients reporting an increase from baseline of â‰¥1 CSBM/week for â‰¥6/12 treatment weeks."
PMC5418559,S10,,Secondary end points included abdominal symptom responder rates (â‰¥30% score improvement from baseline for â‰¥6/12 weeks) and a composite responder rate (CSBM and abdominal pain response in the same week for â‰¥6/12 weeks).
PMC5418559,S11,,Results:
PMC5418559,S12,,"Overall, 356 patients were randomized (mean age: 45.7 years; 86.8% women) and 304 completed the study."
PMC5418559,S13,,"The CSBM responder rate was significantly higher in the tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. group than in the placebo group (60.7 vs. 33.7% P<0.001), as was the composite responder rate (50.0 vs. 23.6% P<0.001)."
PMC5418559,S14,,"Responder rates for abdominal symptoms (pain, discomfort, bloating, cramping, and fullness) were significantly higher in the tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. group than in the placebo group (all P<0.05)."
PMC5418559,S15,,"Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event (tenapanor b.i.d.: 20â€‰mg, 12.4% 50â€‰mg, 11.2%)."
PMC5418559,S16,,Conclusions:
PMC5418559,S17,,Tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. significantly increased stool frequency and reduced abdominal symptoms in patients with IBS-C. Further research into tenapanor as a potential treatment for these patients is justified.
PMC5418559,S18,,Introduction
PMC5418559,S19,,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits (1).
PMC5418559,S20,,"IBS affects 7â€“21% of individuals globally (2, 3), with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) accounting for approximately one-third of cases (4)."
PMC5418559,S21,,"IBS has both a significant societal impact and a significant personal impact, resulting from impaired quality of life, loss of work productivity, and increased healthcare resource utilization (5)."
PMC5418559,S22,,"In addition to typical IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating, patients with IBS-C commonly report hard and infrequent stools, straining, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation (6)."
PMC5418559,S23,,"Patients with IBS-C also have a substantially impaired quality of life (4, 5)."
PMC5418559,S24,,"The negative impacts of IBS-C are often similar to (or worse than) those observed in chronic diseases that are traditionally perceived as being more serious than IBS, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus (7, 8, 9)."
PMC5418559,S25,,"Diagnosis of IBS-C and adequate treatment of individuals with IBS-C present significant challenges, owing to the diverse and dynamic nature of symptoms that accompany a symptom-based diagnosis of diverse pathogenesis (10)."
PMC5418559,S26,,"Historically, laxatives, dietary fiber, and stool softeners were recommended to patients with IBS-C; however, the evidence supporting these treatments is variable in quantity and quality, and low treatment satisfaction has been reported (10, 11)."
PMC5418559,S27,,"More recent therapies targeting IBS-C symptoms include the guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist linaclotide (12, 13) and the selective chloride channel activator lubiprostone (14), both of which are minimally absorbed and act in the gastrointestinal tract."
PMC5418559,S28,,"Though linaclotide and lubiprostone have been shown to be more effective than placebo in large randomized controlled trials, fewer than half of patients with IBS-C achieved the primary end points of improvements in stool frequency and abdominal pain (13, 14)."
PMC5418559,S29,,"Thus, despite the availability of these treatments, there remains an unmet need for further therapeutic options for some patients with IBS-C who continue to experience symptoms (12, 13, 14)."
PMC5418559,S30,,"Tenapanor is a first-in-class, small-molecule inhibitor of the gastrointestinal sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3."
PMC5418559,S31,,"Tenapanor acts in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce the absorption of sodium and phosphate, with minimal systemic drug exposure (15)."
PMC5418559,S32,,"Increased sodium retention in the gut in healthy volunteers treated with tenapanor enhances intestinal fluid volume and transit, as demonstrated by softer stools and an increase in the frequency of bowel movements (16)."
PMC5418559,S33,,Preclinical studies also suggest that tenapanor may exert antinociceptive effects on visceral sensation (17).
PMC5418559,S34,,"Based on these findings, tenapanor was evaluated over 4 weeks at three once-daily doses (10, 30, and 100â€‰mg) in patients with IBS-C in a placebo-controlled study, with tenapanor treatment resulting in improvements in IBS-C symptoms (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01340053) (18)."
PMC5418559,S35,,A study of tenapanor in healthy volunteers suggested that twice-daily dosing was more effective than once-daily dosing at the equivalent total daily dose at increasing stool sodium (19).
PMC5418559,S36,,"We therefore conducted the present phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of three, twice-daily doses of tenapanor (5, 20, and 50â€‰mg) for the treatment of patients with IBS-C."

PMC5418559,S139,,"Of those AEs occurring in at least 3% of patients in any tenapanor group and at a higher frequency than in the placebo group, the most frequently reported were diarrhea, headache, nausea, urinary tract infection, and abdominal pain."
PMC5418559,S140,,"Treatment-related AEs potentially relating to dehydration were rare in the study, with one patient reporting dry mouth in the placebo group and one patient reporting thirst in the tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. group."

PMC5418559,S142,,"None of the serious AEs were considered by the study site investigator to be related to study drug treatment and no serious AEs were reported by patients receiving tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. Treatment-related diarrhea occurred in 24 (9%) of all tenapanor-treated patients (n=266), leading to study-drug discontinuation in nine patients, three (3%) in each of the tenapanor treatment groups."
PMC5418559,S143,,Three patients who received tenapanor 5â€‰mg b.i.d. reported treatment-related abdominal distension that led to study drug discontinuation.
PMC5418559,S144,,No other AEs led to discontinuation in more than two patients in any treatment group.
PMC5418559,S145,,"No deaths occurred over the course of this study and no clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms."
PMC5418559,S146,,"Increases from baseline to week 12 in serum phosphorus concentrations from normal to above normal limits were observed in three patients receiving tenapanor (50â€‰mg b.i.d., n=2; 20â€‰mg b.i.d, n=1) and three patients receiving placebo."
PMC5418559,S147,,"Decreases in serum phosphorus concentrations from baseline to week 12 from normal to below normal limits were observed in two patients receiving tenapanor (50â€‰mg b.i.d., n=1; 5â€‰mg b.i.d., n=1) and one patient receiving placebo."
PMC5418559,S148,,"Decreases in serum sodium concentrations from normal to below normal limits were observed in two patients receiving tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. These changes in serum phosphorus and sodium were not considered to be clinically meaningful, and none were reported as AEs."
PMC5418559,S149,,A total of 291 blood samples from patients in the three tenapanor treatment groups were analyzed to determine tenapanor plasma concentrations.
PMC5418559,S150,,Tenapanor levels were above the quantifiable limit of 0.5â€‰ng/ml in only eight samples (range: 0.547â€“1.03â€‰ng/ml) taken from a total of six individuals in the tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. group at either week 8 or week 12.
PMC5418559,S151,,Discussion
PMC5418559,S152,,"In this methodologically rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. proved to be significantly more effective than placebo at improving symptoms of IBS-C including bowel habits (stool frequency (CSBMs, the primary efficacy variable, and SBMs), stool consistency (BSFS) and straining), abdominal symptoms (pain, discomfort, bloating, cramping, and fullness), as well as a composite end point of increased CSBM frequency and reduced abdominal pain."
PMC5418559,S153,,"In addition, tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. significantly improved global patient-reported treatment measurements compared with placebo including IBS severity, constipation severity, degree of relief from IBS and treatment satisfaction."
PMC5418559,S154,,Benefits were seen during the first week of assessments after therapy had been initiated and were sustained over the 12-week treatment period.
PMC5418559,S155,,"Patients receiving tenapanor 50â€‰mg b.i.d. achieved a mean average of ~3 CSBMs/week for the majority of treatment weeks, exceeding 3 CSBMs/week for half of the 12 weeks."
PMC5418559,S156,,"Notably, data from a population-based study suggests that a frequency of 3 bowel movements/week to 3 bowel movements/day in adults is â€˜normal' (24)."
PMC5418559,S157,,"Patients in the tenapanor 20â€‰mg b.i.d. and 5â€‰mg b.i.d. dose groups did not achieve statistically significant improvements in CSBM frequency or the composite end point compared with placebo, though trends toward improvements were observed for the 20â€‰mg b.i.d. dose."
PMC5418559,S158,,"Tenapanor is a first-in-class inhibitor of sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3, the predominant intestinal sodium transporter (25), and thereby tenapanor reduces sodium uptake in the gut."
PMC5418559,S159,,"This unique mechanism of action leads to increased intestinal fluid volume and shorter transit time (15, 16), which accounts for the softening of stool consistency and increased frequency of bowel movements observed in patients with IBS-C in our study."
PMC5418559,S160,,"Tenapanor treatment also led to robust improvements in one of the key symptoms of IBS-C, abdominal pain."
PMC5418559,S161,,It is possible that improvements in constipation with secondary â€˜unloading' of the colon may have contributed to the improvements in abdominal pain observed with tenapanor.
PMC5418559,S162,,"However, not all drugs that improve constipation also improve abdominal pain."
PMC5418559,S163,,"For example, in a 4-week study, polyethylene glycol treatment provided significant increases over placebo in the number of spontaneous bowel movements, without any improvement over placebo in abdominal pain (26)."
PMC5418559,S164,,"Tenapanor may have direct effects on visceral hypersensitivity, which can be present in patients with IBS-C. Similar to animal studies of linaclotide (27), tenapanor significantly reduced stress-induced colorectal hypersensitivity to mechanical pain stimuli in a rat model (17)."
PMC5418559,S165,,"The mechanism responsible for this effect remains to be fully elucidated, but these findings support the possibility that tenapanor may benefit pain through effects on visceral hypersensitivity."
PMC5418559,S166,,Further studies to better understand the anti-nociceptive effects of tenapanor are encouraged.
PMC5418559,S167,,"A desire to mitigate the risk of serious systemic drug side effects has fueled a recent trend in developing luminally acting therapeutic agents, and the development of tenapanor extends this trend."
PMC5418559,S168,,"Given the minimal systemic availability of tenapanor, as supported by the pharmacokinetic data generated in this study, and its pharmacodynamic effect on sodium/fluid transit in the gastrointestinal tract, it is hardly surprising that the most commonly reported treatment-related AE during the study was diarrhea, occurring in 9% of all tenapanor-treated patients, and causing 3% (n=3) of individuals in each tenapanor group to discontinue treatment."
PMC5418559,S169,,"Otherwise, tenapanor appeared to have a generally acceptable safety profile overall."
PMC5418559,S170,,No serious treatment-related AEs or deaths were reported in any of the study groups.
PMC5418559,S171,,"There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms in the study."
PMC5418559,S172,,"Given the pharmacodynamic effect of tenapanor in reducing absorption of not only sodium, but also of phosphate from the gut, it is noteworthy that there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in serum sodium and phosphorus observed in patients with IBS-C in our study."

PMC5529963,S2,,Anti-inflammatory treatment improves high-density lipoprotein function in rheumatoid arthritis
PMC5529963,S3,,Abstract
PMC5529963,S4,,Objective
PMC5529963,S5,,Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased cardiovascular risk.
PMC5529963,S6,,Recent studies suggest that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may lose its protective vascular phenotype in inflammatory conditions.
PMC5529963,S7,,"However, the effects of common anti-inflammatory treatments on HDL function are not yet known."
PMC5529963,S8,,Methods
PMC5529963,S9,,We compared the function of HDL in 18 patients with RA and 18 matched healthy controls.
PMC5529963,S10,,"Subsequently, patients were randomised to (methotrexate+infliximab (M+I) (5 mg/kg)) or methotrexate+placebo (M+P) infusions for 54â€…weeks."
PMC5529963,S11,,"At week 54 and thereafter, all patients received infliximab therapy until completion of the trial (110â€…weeks), enabling assessment of the impact of 1â€…year of infliximab therapy in all patients."
PMC5529963,S12,,"HDL functional properties were assessed at baseline, 54â€…weeks and 110â€…weeks by measuring the impact on endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and superoxide production (SO), paraoxonase activity (PON-1) and cholesterol efflux."
PMC5529963,S13,,Results
PMC5529963,S14,,All HDL vascular assays were impaired in patients compared with controls.
PMC5529963,S15,,"After 54â€…weeks, NO in response to HDL was significantly greater in patients who received M+I compared with those who received M+P."
PMC5529963,S16,,"Endothelial SO in response to HDL was reduced in both groups, but PON-1 and cholesterol efflux remained unchanged."
PMC5529963,S17,,All vascular measures improved compared with baseline after â‰¥1 infliximab therapy in the analysis at 110â€…weeks.
PMC5529963,S18,,No significant trend was noted for cholesterol efflux.
PMC5529963,S19,,Conclusions
PMC5529963,S20,,HDL function can be improved with anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with RA.
PMC5529963,S21,,"The M+I combination was superior to the M+P alone, suggesting that the tumour necrosis factor-Î± pathway may have a role in HDL vascular properties."
PMC5529963,S22,,Introduction
PMC5529963,S23,,Cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).1
PMC5529963,S24,,"Conventional risk factors do not account fully for this, and increased levels of inflammation associated with RA may be an important determinant of CV outcomes.2"
PMC5529963,S25,,"In a study of 651 patients, an elevated inflammatory state was associated with an increased CV event rate but a paradoxical reduction in circulating lipid levels.3"
PMC5529963,S26,,"This suggests that the relationship between lipid levels and increased CV disease is altered in RA and may be explained, at least in part, by qualitative changes to lipoproteins as a result of the inflammatory milieu."
PMC5529963,S27,,High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been suggested to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects via reverse cholesterol transport and activation of protective endothelial pathways.
PMC5529963,S28,,"In conditions such as RA however, HDL has been shown to acquire pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic phenotype that can promote atherogenesis and potentially increase CV risk.4 5"
PMC5529963,S29,,"A previous study from our group demonstrated that the beneficial function of HDL can be restored after resolution of acute inflammatory stimulus, suggesting that the modification of systemic inflammation offers potential for CV risk reduction.6"
PMC5529963,S30,,"In our current study, we examined the influence of standard (methotrexate (MTX)) and novel anti-inflammatory treatments (infliximab) on HDL function in patients with RA in a randomised controlled trial over 1â€…year."
PMC5529963,S31,,We also assessed the long-term effect of infliximab on HDL function and CV and RA risk factors.
PMC5529963,S32,,Our findings support the concept that HDL dysfunction can be improved by anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used for RA therapy and this may confer CV benefit.

PMC5529963,S157,,Discussion
PMC5529963,S158,,This study shows that anti-inflammatory treatments can improve the antioxidant and endothelial protective properties of HDL in patients with erosive RA.
PMC5529963,S159,,These effects were not accompanied by changes in cholesterol efflux and tracked improvements in RA disease activity.
PMC5529963,S160,,"Treatment with infliximab in addition to MTX for 2â€…years showed a benefit for a broad range of HDL functional properties including NO bioavailability, SO production and PON-1 activity."
PMC5529963,S161,,"These findings suggest that there is a role for anti-inflammatory treatments, particularly those targeting the TNF-Î± pathway, for improving not only RA disease activity but also potentially CV risk factors in patients with RA."
PMC5529963,S162,,The threefold increased risk of CV disease in patients with RA is not accounted for by traditional risk factors and is related to increased levels of inflammation.2
PMC5529963,S163,,This influences a range of CV risk factors and causes quantitative and qualitative changes to lipoproteins.13
PMC5529963,S164,,"Substantial evidence has now accumulated, suggesting that inflammation can convert the normally protective HDL into a â€˜particle with adverse effects on endothelial functionâ€™.4 14"
PMC5529963,S165,,"We showed that HDL has several dysfunctional properties in patients with RA, which may contribute to their increased CV risk."
PMC5529963,S166,,Our findings are in agreement with previous evidence describing a pro-inflammatory HDL particle with reduced PON-1 activity.15
PMC5529963,S167,,We have now demonstrated an impairment of the beneficial effects of HDL on endothelium with a marked decrease in the stimulation of endothelial NO and increase in SO production compared with healthy controls.
PMC5529963,S168,,"Diminished production of NO may reflect endothelial dysfunction, an early step in atherogenesis, and represents a novel pathway by which HDL dysfunction can promote arterial disease in patients with RA."
PMC5529963,S169,,We evaluated the potential for HDL function to be restored following treatment with RA anti-inflammatory therapies.
PMC5529963,S170,,MTX is commonly used as a first-line treatment in early RA.
PMC5529963,S171,,Observational studies have demonstrated reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke with MTX therapy and the ongoing CIRT trial is evaluating the drug in secondary CV prevention.16 17
PMC5529963,S172,,"Its exact anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain uncertain, although it has been shown to mediate increased extracellular accumulation of adenosine around connective tissue and reduce levels of CRP and interleukin-6.17"
PMC5529963,S173,,Biological inhibition of TNF-Î± with infliximab in addition to MTX is a more effective approach for reducing RA disease activity.
PMC5529963,S174,,TNF-Î± is a proximal cytokine and its blockade has well-established anti-inflammatory actions and effects on lipid metabolism.18
PMC5529963,S175,,"At 54â€…weeks, NO bioavailability was significantly improved in patients who received infliximab, but not with MTX."
PMC5529963,S176,,Infliximab has previously been associated with increased AKT/eNOS phosphorylation and improved endothelial function.19 20
PMC5529963,S177,,Our study provides a novel mechanism by which infliximab can improve endothelial function and contribute to vascular protection by TNF-Î± inhibition.
PMC5529963,S178,,"After 1â€…year of our double-blinded randomised trial, SO production was significantly reduced in both arms."
PMC5529963,S179,,"MTX is known to inhibit several inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators, associated with increased lipid peroxidation.21"
PMC5529963,S180,,Oxidative modification of the HDL particle alters its protective phenotype.22
PMC5529963,S181,,Combination therapy with infliximab caused an additional reduction of SO production compared with MTX alone.
PMC5529963,S182,,"Previous studies of infliximab in humans suggest that TNF-Î± inhibition protects against oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, and this may explain its additional efficacy in reducing SO production.23"
PMC5529963,S183,,"Despite a trend towards an increased benefit of infliximab therapy at 1â€…year, between-treatment comparisons did not reach statistical significance."
PMC5529963,S184,,Assay of PON-1 provided an additional measure of the antioxidative function of HDL but no significant difference was found in the double-blinded randomised study in either arm at 1â€…year possibly due to the small sample size.
PMC5529963,S185,,"However, PON-1 activity was improved in the single-blinded study at 1 and 2â€…years treatment of infliximab."
PMC5529963,S186,,"While the effect of MTX on PON-1 activity has not previously been reported, infliximab is known to improve PON-1 activity through the reduction of lipid peroxidation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) pathways.24"
PMC5529963,S187,,Site-specific oxidative modification of PON-1 by MPO impairs the enzymes ability to bind with APOA-1 and reduced MPO could explain the increased PON-1 activity in our patients.25
PMC5529963,S188,,We did not demonstrate any differences in cholesterol efflux with either treatment regimen.
PMC5529963,S189,,This suggests that anti-inflammatory therapies have a more pronounced impact on the vascular properties of HDL than on its efflux capacity.
PMC5529963,S190,,These findings support previous reports from our group and indicate that the endothelial function of HDL may be more sensitive to modification than cholesterol efflux.6
PMC5529963,S191,,"However, anti-inflammatory treatments including MTX and infliximab have recently been associated with improved cholesterol efflux in patients with RA, and associated with CV disease in both healthy and at-risk populations.10 26â€“28"
PMC5529963,S192,,"These differences may be due to methodological issues in the efflux measurement and their interpretation, and require further investigation."
PMC5529963,S193,,"Our study was not powered to assess the quantitative relationship between HDL function, inflammation and disease activity."
PMC5529963,S194,,"This also limited our ability to test for between-treatment differences in the randomised study design, although combination therapy demonstrated a clear benefit in the single-blinded study."
PMC5529963,S195,,"However, we have demonstrated that a range of vascular properties of HDL can be improved with anti-inflammatory drug therapy."
PMC5529963,S196,,"HDL function did not return to normal levels following treatment, and this is likely to be as a result of the residual levels of inflammation even after 2â€…years treatment (data not shown)."
PMC5529963,S197,,The ability of anti-inflammatory treatments to modify CV risk remains an intense area of clinical research.
PMC5529963,S198,,"Currently, three anti-inflammatory agents are the subject of phase III trials; MTX (CIRT), Darapladib (SOLID-TMI and STABILITY) and canakinumab (CANTOS)."
PMC5529963,S199,,"Recently, both the STABILITY and SOLID-TMI trials reported that darapladib failed to reduce the risk of CV death and myocardial infarction in primary and secondary prevention.29 30"
PMC5529963,S200,,"The CIRT and CANTOS trials are due to report shortly, but our data suggest that monotherapy with MTX alone may not be sufficient."
PMC5529963,S201,,"Inhibition of TNF-Î±, a broad immune effector, is more likely to suppress inflammation and may be a better strategy for CV benefit."
PMC5529963,S202,,This study underlines the need to measure and better understand HDL function.
PMC5529963,S203,,"It provides evidence for the use of anti-inflammatory treatments, particularly those modulating the TNF-Î± pathway, to restore the beneficial effects of HDL on the vasculature."
PMC5529963,S204,,Our findings are of relevance to many recent clinical trials evaluating both HDL elevation and anti-inflammatory therapies with the aim of reducing CV risk.
PMC5529963,S205,,Key messages
PMC5529963,S206,,What is already known on this subject?
PMC5529963,S207,,"Clinical trials aimed at raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol have thus far failed to improve cardiovascular (CV) outcome, and this may be explained by a dysfunctional HDL phenotype in disease."
